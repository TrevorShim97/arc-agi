========== SYSTEM PROMPT ==========

You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids." A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers (list[list[int]] in python code). Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output. You must resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule before returning the predicted output grid. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. As another example, if some shape(s) or cells in the input are relocated or recolored, you need to determine which exact shapes should be relocated/recolored in the output and where they should be moved or what their color in the output should be. Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before returning the predicted output grid. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step-by-step reasoning.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1-cell holes are filled with pink, 2-cell holes are filled with blue, and 3-cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before returning the predicted output grid.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, return the predicted output grid enclosed in <output></output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. DO NOT include any other text or code within the <output> tags except for the output grid.

You might also be provided with an incorrect output grid that you've returned for these examples during a previous attempt. If you are provided with an incorrect previous answer, you should carefully read through its reasoning to figure out what went wrong and return a corrected output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples in detail:

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - There are three distinct colors in each input: red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).
   - In each example, these colors are present only once in the grid.

2. **Transformation Observations:**
   - A path of grey (5) is created connecting these colored cells in the output.
   - The path connects from the cell with the smallest number to the largest, in the order red (2) → green (3) → yellow (4).

3. **Path Creation:**
   - The path seems to be formed by filling in the shortest path between these cells using grey (5).
   - The path uses only horizontal and vertical connections, not diagonals.

4. **Order of Connection:**
   - The connection order is consistent across all examples: start from the red cell (2), connect to the green cell (3), and finally connect to the yellow cell (4).

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Example 1: Connect (2,1) to (11,3) to (6,10).
   - Example 2: Connect (1,5) to (10,2) to (8,11).
   - Example 3: Connect (1,1) to (10,5) to (4,11).
   - Example 4: Connect (5,2) to (11,9) to (1,10).

6. **Conclusion:**
   The rule is to find the red (2), green (3), and yellow (4) cells, and connect them in this order with a path of grey (5). The path should consist of the shortest horizontal and vertical segments connecting these points.

Now, let's apply this rule to the new input:

- Red is located at (5,1), green at (11,7), and yellow at (2,10).
- Connect (5,1) to (11,7) to (2,10) using grey (5).

Let's implement this transformation for the new input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, we need to carefully analyze the given examples to identify patterns and transformations applied to the input grids to produce the output grids.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains three distinct colored single cells: red (2), yellow (4), and green (3).
   - Output: The red cell has a horizontal line of grey (5) extending to the right, up to the position of another colored cell. The yellow cell has a vertical line of grey extending upwards. The green cell remains unchanged.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains three distinct colored single cells: green (3), red (2), and yellow (4).
   - Output: The green cell has a vertical line of grey extending downwards. The red cell has a horizontal line of grey extending to the left. The yellow cell remains unchanged.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains three distinct colored single cells: yellow (4), green (3), and red (2).
   - Output: The yellow cell has a horizontal line of grey extending rightwards. The green cell has a vertical line of grey extending upwards. The red cell remains unchanged.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains three distinct colored single cells: yellow (4), red (2), and green (3).
   - Output: The yellow cell has a vertical line of grey extending downwards. The red cell has a horizontal line of grey extending to the right. The green cell remains unchanged.

### Pattern Recognition:

- It appears that the transformation involves each colored cell (other than green) being extended in one direction with grey (5) until it reaches the position of another colored cell.
- The direction of extension seems to depend on the specific color:
  - Red (2): Extends horizontally.
  - Yellow (4): Extends vertically.
  - Green (3): Does not have any grey extension; it remains unchanged.

### Transformation Rule:

1. For each red (2) cell, fill horizontally with grey (5) until another colored cell is encountered.
2. For each yellow (4) cell, fill vertically with grey (5) until another colored cell is encountered.
3. Green (3) cells remain unchanged.

### Applying the Rule to the Additional Input:

- The additional input contains:
  - A yellow (4) cell at position (2, 10).
  - A red (2) cell at position (5, 1).
  - A green (3) cell at position (11, 7).

Applying the transformation rule:
- Yellow (4) at (2, 10) will extend vertically upwards with grey (5) until it reaches the top of the grid.
- Red (2) at (5, 1) will extend horizontally rightwards with grey (5) until it reaches the position of the yellow (4) cell.
- Green (3) at (11, 7) remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:

Based on the identified transformation rule, we can now generate the output for the additional test input.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples step by step.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow).
   - Output: The colors remain in their original positions, but there's a path of grey (5) connecting them.
   - The path of grey starts from the red, goes horizontally to the right, then down vertically, and finally connects to the yellow.
   - From yellow, the grey path continues vertically upwards to connect with the green.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 3 (green), 2 (red), 4 (yellow).
   - Output: Colors remain in place, and a path of grey (5) connects them.
   - The grey path starts from green, goes downward vertically to red, and then horizontally to yellow.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 4 (yellow), 3 (green), 2 (red).
   - Output: Colors remain in their original positions, and a grey (5) path connects them.
   - The path starts from yellow, moves horizontally to the right, then vertically downwards to green, and finally horizontally to the red.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 4 (yellow), 2 (red), 3 (green).
   - Output: Colors remain and a grey (5) path connects them.
   - The path starts from yellow, moves vertically downwards to red, continues to the right, and finally goes upwards to connect with green.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- The transformation involves creating a path of grey (5) that starts from one color and sequentially connects all other colors.
- The path doesn't change the original colored positions.
- The path seems to connect the colors in a specific order: starting from the top-most or left-most color and moving in a sequential manner to connect all colors.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

The additional test input has distinct colors in the positions:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
- Start the grey path from red (2) at (5,1).
- Move horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with yellow (4) at (2,10).
- Finally, move vertically and horizontally to connect with the green (3) at (11,7).

The grey path will thus connect all colored cells in a sequential manner.

Response: <reasoning>
To deduce the transformation rule applied to the input grids to obtain the output grids, let's analyze the given examples in detail:

1. **Identify colored cells in inputs and their role in outputs:**
   - In each example, there are three distinct colors (non-zero values) located in the input grid. The colors are red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). 
   - These colored cells remain unchanged in the output grid, maintaining their positions and values.

2. **Observe the addition of grey (5) cells in the output grid:**
   - Grey cells (5) are added in the output grids around the colored cells.
   - The pattern of grey cells seems to form a continuous path or line connecting the colored cells, perhaps in a specific order.

3. **Determine the path rule:**
   - Let's observe the sequence in which these colored cells are connected:
     - Example 1: The path starts from red (2) at (2,1), extends horizontally to the right, turns vertically downwards, and ends at yellow (4) at (6,10). The green (3) at (11,3) is off the path, indicating that it might be the last point in this sequence.
     - Example 2: The path begins from green (3) at (1,5), extends vertically downwards, turns horizontally leftwards, and ends at red (2) at (8,11). The yellow (4) at (10,2) is off the path, suggesting it might be the last point.
     - Example 3: The path goes from yellow (4) at (1,1), extends horizontally to the right, turns vertically downwards, and ends at green (3) at (4,11). Red (2) at (10,5) is off the path.
     - Example 4: The path starts from yellow (4) at (1,10), extends vertically downwards, turns horizontally leftwards, and ends at red (2) at (5,2). Green (3) at (11,9) is off the path.

4. **Order of connection:**
   - The pattern suggests that the path connects the colored cells in a consistent order: yellow (4) first, red (2) second, and green (3) last. This order is determined by the positions of the colored cells.

5. **Conclusion on transformation rule:**
   - For each input grid, identify the colored cells: yellow, red, and green.
   - Draw a path starting from yellow, connecting to red, and finally ending at green using grey cells (5), forming a continuous line.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the additional input provided:

- Starting from yellow (4) at (2,10), connect to red (2) at (5,1) using grey (5) cells, and then continue the path to green (3) at (11,7).

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step.

### Observations:

1. **Input Structure**:
   - Each input grid contains three distinct non-zero colored cells scattered on a 13x13 grid. The colors are represented by integers: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

2. **Output Structure**:
   - In each output grid, we observe the introduction of grey colored cells (represented by 5) creating a path or connection between the non-zero colored cells.
   - The original non-zero colored cells are preserved in their positions.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In Example 1, the grey cells form a path connecting the red, yellow, and green cells. The path between the red and yellow cells is horizontal, while the path from the yellow to green cell is vertical.
   - In Example 2, the grey cells form vertical and horizontal connections between the cells.
   - In Example 3, the grey cells form a path that starts at the yellow cell and connects to the green and red cells.
   - In Example 4, similar paths are formed connecting the colored cells.

### Transformation Rule:

The rule appears to be as follows:
- Identify the non-zero colored cells (2, 3, 4) in the grid.
- Connect these colored cells using a path of grey cells (5). The path should ensure all colored cells are connected directly or indirectly.
- The path should be the shortest possible, using vertical and horizontal lines only.

### Applying the Rule:

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

- Colored cells are located at:
  - (2, 10) with color 4 (yellow)
  - (5, 1) with color 2 (red)
  - (11, 7) with color 3 (green)

To connect these:
- Start from the red cell (5, 1), draw a vertical line of grey cells up to connect to the yellow cell (2, 10).
- From the yellow cell (2, 10), draw a horizontal line to connect to the green cell (11, 7).

This should form the required grey path connecting all the colored cells.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step.

### Observations:

1. **Input Structure**:
   - Each input grid contains three distinct non-zero colored cells scattered on a 13x13 grid. The colors are represented by integers: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

2. **Output Structure**:
   - In each output grid, we observe the introduction of grey colored cells (represented by 5) creating a path or connection between the non-zero colored cells.
   - The original non-zero colored cells are preserved in their positions.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - In Example 1, the grey cells form a path connecting the red, yellow, and green cells. The path between the red and yellow cells is horizontal, while the path from the yellow to green cell is vertical.
   - In Example 2, the grey cells form vertical and horizontal connections between the cells.
   - In Example 3, the grey cells form a path that starts at the yellow cell and connects to the green and red cells.
   - In Example 4, similar paths are formed connecting the colored cells.

### Transformation Rule:

The rule appears to be as follows:
- Identify the non-zero colored cells (2, 3, 4) in the grid.
- Connect these colored cells using a path of grey cells (5). The path should ensure all colored cells are connected directly or indirectly.
- The path should be the shortest possible, using vertical and horizontal lines only.

### Applying the Rule:

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

- Colored cells are located at:
  - (2, 10) with color 4 (yellow)
  - (5, 1) with color 2 (red)
  - (11, 7) with color 3 (green)

To connect these:
- Start from the red cell (5, 1), draw a vertical line of grey cells up to connect to the yellow cell (2, 10).
- From the yellow cell (2, 10), draw a horizontal line to connect to the green cell (11, 7).

This should form the required grey path connecting all the colored cells.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples step by step.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 2 (red), 3 (green), 4 (yellow).
   - Output: The colors remain in their original positions, but there's a path of grey (5) connecting them.
   - The path of grey starts from the red, goes horizontally to the right, then down vertically, and finally connects to the yellow.
   - From yellow, the grey path continues vertically upwards to connect with the green.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 3 (green), 2 (red), 4 (yellow).
   - Output: Colors remain in place, and a path of grey (5) connects them.
   - The grey path starts from green, goes downward vertically to red, and then horizontally to yellow.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 4 (yellow), 3 (green), 2 (red).
   - Output: Colors remain in their original positions, and a grey (5) path connects them.
   - The path starts from yellow, moves horizontally to the right, then vertically downwards to green, and finally horizontally to the red.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has distinct colors: 4 (yellow), 2 (red), 3 (green).
   - Output: Colors remain and a grey (5) path connects them.
   - The path starts from yellow, moves vertically downwards to red, continues to the right, and finally goes upwards to connect with green.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- The transformation involves creating a path of grey (5) that starts from one color and sequentially connects all other colors.
- The path doesn't change the original colored positions.
- The path seems to connect the colors in a specific order: starting from the top-most or left-most color and moving in a sequential manner to connect all colors.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

The additional test input has distinct colors in the positions:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
- Start the grey path from red (2) at (5,1).
- Move horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with yellow (4) at (2,10).
- Finally, move vertically and horizontally to connect with the green (3) at (11,7).

The grey path will thus connect all colored cells in a sequential manner.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's analyze the given examples to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations:

1. **Input Structure**:
   - Each input grid contains three distinct non-zero colored cells scattered on a 13x13 grid. The colors are represented by integers: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

2. **Output Structure**:
   - In each output grid, the original colored cells remain in their original positions.
   - Grey cells (represented by 5) are introduced to form a path or connection between the non-zero colored cells.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The path of grey cells connects the three non-zero colored cells using vertical and horizontal lines.
   - The grey path does not form loops or go through the same point twice. It is the "shortest path" connecting all three colored cells directly or indirectly.

### Common Mistakes in Previous Responses:

- Both previous responses correctly identified that grey paths connect the colored cells, but they incorrectly constructed the paths.
- The paths constructed did not consider the shortest path or correct sequence as indicated by the examples.

### Correct Transformation Rule:

To form the correct grey path:
- Identify the positions of the three colored cells (2, 3, 4).
- Form a path that connects these cells using the shortest possible route, ensuring all cells are connected either directly or indirectly.
- Use horizontal and vertical lines only, without forming loops or extraneous paths.

### Applying the Correct Rule to the Additional Input:

For the additional test input, colored cells are located at:
- Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
- Red (2) at (5, 1)
- Green (3) at (11, 7)

To connect these:
1. Start from the red cell (5, 1) and draw a vertical path upwards to (2, 1).
2. From (2, 1), move horizontally towards the yellow cell (2, 10).
3. From (2, 10), draw a vertical path downwards to connect with the green cell (11, 7).

This arrangement ensures the shortest path is created, connecting all colored cells in sequence.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, we need to carefully analyze the provided examples and identify patterns that are consistent across them.

### Observations from Given Examples:

1. **Common Colors:**
   - The input grids contain three distinct non-zero colors: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
   - The positions of these colored cells remain unchanged in the output grids.

2. **Grey Path (Color 5):**
   - A path of grey cells (represented by 5) is added to the grid in the output.
   - This path connects the colored cells, forming a continuous line between them.
   - The path uses only horizontal and vertical moves.

3. **Connection Order:**
   - In each example, the grey path starts from one of the colored cells and connects to the others. The order in which the path connects these cells is crucial.
   - The path seems to start from the leftmost or topmost colored cell and proceeds to connect the other two.

### Deduced Transformation Rule:

- **Identify Positions of Colored Cells:** Locate the positions of the non-zero colored cells in the input grid.
- **Determine Starting Point:** Begin the grey path from the leftmost or topmost colored cell based on the input grid.
- **Connect Using Shortest Path:** Connect all colored cells using a path of grey cells (5) while ensuring that the path only uses horizontal and vertical lines.
- **Preserve Colored Cell Positions:** Keep the original colored cells in their positions.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

The additional test input has colored cells at the following positions:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
- **Determine Starting Point:** Start from the topmost colored cell, which is yellow (4) at (2,10).
- **Connect Paths:**
  - From yellow (4) at (2,10), draw a horizontal grey path to red (2) at (5,1).
  - Continue the grey path vertically downwards from red (2) to green (3) at (11,7).

The grey path should connect all colored cells in the shortest manner while using only horizontal and vertical lines.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-evaluate the examples more carefully.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), and 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - The output maintains these colored cells and introduces grey (5) cells to connect them.
   - The grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally moves vertically to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), and 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, extends vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally back horizontally and vertically to connect with the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), and 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, extends horizontally to connect with the green cell, and then moves horizontally and vertically to connect with the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), and 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to connect with the red cell, and finally upwards to connect with the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero cells with grey (5) cells in a specific manner:
- The path of grey cells starts from one of the non-zero colored cells.
- The grey path connects these cells in a sequence by using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines.
- The rule seems to prioritize starting from the top-most or left-most color and connecting all colors sequentially.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1).
2. Move vertically down to the green cell at (11,7).
3. From the green cell, move horizontally to the yellow cell at (2,10).

This grey path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a shortest possible sequence.

Let's correct the previous outputs by connecting the colors based on the observed path pattern:

- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)

Connect them with the shortest path of grey cells (5):
1. From red (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1).
2. Move horizontally from (11,1) to (11,7).
3. From (11,7), move vertically up to (2,7).
4. Move horizontally from (2,7) to (2,10).

This connection follows the adjacency rule observed in the examples.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses and the provided examples, let's try to clarify the transformation rule again and identify the errors in the previous responses.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Consistent Aspects:**
   - Each input grid contains three non-zero colored cells (red, green, yellow).
   - The outputs maintain these colored cells in their original positions.
   - The outputs introduce grey cells (5) that form paths connecting these colored cells.

2. **Pattern of Grey Paths:**
   - In Example 1, the grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right in the same row, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and from there continues vertically down to the green cell.
   - In Example 2, the grey path starts from the green cell, goes vertically down to the red cell, and from there extends horizontally right to the yellow cell.
   - In Example 3, the grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves horizontally to the right, vertically down to the green cell, and from there horizontally to the red cell.
   - In Example 4, the grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically down to the red cell, then horizontally to the right to the edge of the grid, and finally vertically up to connect with the green cell.

3. **Rule Deduction:**
   - The grey path connects all colored cells. The path seems to start from the topmost or leftmost colored cell and then connect to the others using horizontal and vertical lines.
   - The starting point for the grey path might depend on the positions of the colored cells, prioritizing the leftmost and topmost positions.

4. **Errors in Previous Responses:**
   - Both responses failed to correctly identify the start and connections of the grey paths. The paths were not consistent with how the paths in the examples were constructed, particularly how they connect the colors.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
- Identify the positions of the colored cells.
- Start the grey path from the topmost and leftmost colored cell.
- Connect the cells using the shortest path that involves only horizontal and vertical lines.
- Ensure the path is contiguous and connects all colored cells in a manner consistent with the examples.

### Applying the Rule to New Input:

Input positions are:
- Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
- Red (2) at (5, 1)
- Green (3) at (11, 7)

Applying the rule:
- Start the grey path from the red cell (5, 1).
- Move horizontally right to (5, 10) to align with the yellow cell (2, 10).
- Move vertically to reach the yellow cell.
- From the yellow cell, move vertically down to align with the green cell.
- Finally, connect with the green cell (11, 7).

Re-checking the transformation rule against the examples, this should create a correct grey path that connects all colored cells.

Response: <reasoning>
To accurately determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples again with a focus on the path-creation process and the sequence of connections between colored cells.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Colored Cells and Grid Size:**
   - Each grid is 13x13 and contains three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

2. **Output Structure:**
   - Each output grid retains the original positions of the colored cells.
   - Additional grey cells (5) are used to create paths connecting these colored cells.

3. **Path Creation:**
   - In Example 1, the path connects the red to yellow horizontally, then to green vertically.
   - In Example 2, the path connects the green to red vertically, then to yellow horizontally.
   - In Example 3, the path connects the yellow to green vertically, then to red horizontally.
   - In Example 4, the path connects the yellow to red horizontally, then to green vertically.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- **Path Strategy:** The grey path is created to connect all colored cells. The path uses vertical and horizontal lines and is constructed in segments that ensure all colored cells are connected.
- **Starting Point:** The path starts from the left-most or top-most colored cell, expanding first to other colored cells in the same row or column if possible.
- **Connection Order:** The order of connection seems to be a combination of proximity and orientation, generally starting horizontally or vertically from the initial cell and connecting to the next nearest colored cell.

### Application to Additional Input:

For the additional input grid, the colored cells are located at:
- Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
- Red (2) at (5, 1)
- Green (3) at (11, 7)

To connect these cells with grey (5):
1. **Determine Starting Point:** Start from the red cell at (5, 1) because it is the left-most.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - From red (5, 1), move horizontally to the right to fill grey cells until reaching the column of the green cell (11, 7).
   - Move vertically down from the same row to reach the row of the green (3).
   - Once reaching the green cell, continue horizontally to connect with the yellow cell (2, 10), ensuring all paths are direct and involve minimal steps.

This approach ensures all colored cells are connected with the shortest grey path.

3. **Correct Path Creation:** Ensure the path follows this connection order and aligns with the examples, maintaining direct paths.

This analysis helps identify the issue in previous responses, where the correct path sequence and connection order were not fully adhered to. The corrected output should reflect this accurate path strategy.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-evaluate the examples more carefully.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), and 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - The output maintains these colored cells and introduces grey (5) cells to connect them.
   - The grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally moves vertically to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), and 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, extends vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally back horizontally and vertically to connect with the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), and 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, extends horizontally to connect with the green cell, and then moves horizontally and vertically to connect with the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), and 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to connect with the red cell, and finally upwards to connect with the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero cells with grey (5) cells in a specific manner:
- The path of grey cells starts from one of the non-zero colored cells.
- The grey path connects these cells in a sequence by using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines.
- The rule seems to prioritize starting from the top-most or left-most color and connecting all colors sequentially.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1).
2. Move vertically down to the green cell at (11,7).
3. From the green cell, move horizontally to the yellow cell at (2,10).

This grey path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a shortest possible sequence.

Let's correct the previous outputs by connecting the colors based on the observed path pattern:

- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)

Connect them with the shortest path of grey cells (5):
1. From red (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1).
2. Move horizontally from (11,1) to (11,7).
3. From (11,7), move vertically up to (2,7).
4. Move horizontally from (2,7) to (2,10).

This connection follows the adjacency rule observed in the examples.

1. **Colored Cells and Grid Size:**
   - Each grid is 13x13 and contains three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).

2. **Output Structure:**
   - Each output grid retains the original positions of the colored cells.
   - Additional grey cells (5) are used to create paths connecting these colored cells.

3. **Path Creation:**
   - In Example 1, the path connects the red to yellow horizontally, then to green vertically.
   - In Example 2, the path connects the green to red vertically, then to yellow horizontally.
   - In Example 3, the path connects the yellow to green vertically, then to red horizontally.
   - In Example 4, the path connects the yellow to red horizontally, then to green vertically.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- **Path Strategy:** The grey path is created to connect all colored cells. The path uses vertical and horizontal lines and is constructed in segments that ensure all colored cells are connected.
- **Starting Point:** The path starts from the left-most or top-most colored cell, expanding first to other colored cells in the same row or column if possible.
- **Connection Order:** The order of connection seems to be a combination of proximity and orientation, generally starting horizontally or vertically from the initial cell and connecting to the next nearest colored cell.

### Application to Additional Input:

For the additional input grid, the colored cells are located at:
- Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
- Red (2) at (5, 1)
- Green (3) at (11, 7)

To connect these cells with grey (5):
1. **Determine Starting Point:** Start from the red cell at (5, 1) because it is the left-most.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - From red (5, 1), move horizontally to the right to fill grey cells until reaching the column of the green cell (11, 7).
   - Move vertically down from the same row to reach the row of the green (3).
   - Once reaching the green cell, continue horizontally to connect with the yellow cell (2, 10), ensuring all paths are direct and involve minimal steps.

This approach ensures all colored cells are connected with the shortest grey path.

3. **Correct Path Creation:** Ensure the path follows this connection order and aligns with the examples, maintaining direct paths.

This analysis helps identify the issue in previous responses, where the correct path sequence and connection order were not fully adhered to. The corrected output should reflect this accurate path strategy.

</output>


Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-evaluate the examples more carefully, focusing on the path-creation process and the sequence of connections between colored cells.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Colored cells are located at:
     - Red (2) at (2,1)
     - Yellow (4) at (6,10)
     - Green (3) at (11,3)
   - The grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally moves vertically to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Colored cells are located at:
     - Green (3) at (1,5)
     - Red (2) at (8,11)
     - Yellow (4) at (10,2)
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, extends vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally back horizontally and vertically to connect with the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Colored cells are located at:
     - Yellow (4) at (1,1)
     - Green (3) at (4,12)
     - Red (2) at (10,5)
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, extends horizontally to connect with the green cell, and then moves horizontally and vertically to connect with the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Colored cells are located at:
     - Yellow (4) at (1,10)
     - Red (2) at (5,2)
     - Green (3) at (11,9)
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to connect with the red cell, and finally upwards to connect with the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero cells with grey (5) cells using the shortest path, which can be either horizontal or vertical. 

1. **Path Strategy:** 
   - The grey path starts from the left-most or top-most colored cell.
   - The path connects these cells using direct vertical and horizontal lines.
   - The connections are made in the order of proximity and position, aiming to create the shortest path.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1) because it is the left-most.
2. Move horizontally to the column of the green cell at (11,1).
3. From there, move vertically down to the green cell at (11,7).
4. Finally, move horizontally to connect to the yellow cell at (11,10).

The corrected path should involve the minimal number of steps while connecting all the colored cells. The previous mistakes stemmed from incorrect path construction which did not align with the observed examples.

Let's apply this corrected reasoning to the additional test input.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the examples again to understand the path construction between the colored cells.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has three non-zero colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - The output maintains these colored cells and introduces grey (5) cells connecting them.
   - The grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally moves vertically to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), and 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, extends vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally back horizontally and vertically to connect with the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), and 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, extends horizontally to connect with the green cell, and then moves horizontally and vertically to connect with the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), and 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to connect with the red cell, and finally upwards to connect with the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero cells with grey (5) cells in a specific manner:
- The path of grey cells starts from one of the non-zero colored cells.
- The grey path connects these cells in a sequence by using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines.
- The rule seems to prioritize starting from the top-most or left-most color and connecting all colors sequentially.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1).
2. Move vertically down to the green cell at (11,7).
3. From the green cell, move horizontally to the yellow cell at (2,10).

This grey path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a shortest possible sequence.

Let's correct the previous outputs by connecting the colors based on the observed path pattern:

- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)

Connect them with the shortest path of grey cells (5):
1. From red (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1).
2. Move horizontally from (11,1) to (11,7).
3. From (11,7), move vertically up to (2,7).
4. Move horizontally from (2,7) to (2,10).

This connection follows the adjacency rule observed in the examples.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, we will need to analyze the examples again, focusing on how the paths are constructed to connect the colored cells.

### Key Observations from Examples:

1. Each grid is 13x13 and contains exactly three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow).
2. The transformation involves adding grey (5) cells to create paths that connect these colored cells.
3. The starting point for the path seems to be the left-most or top-most colored cell.
4. The grey path connects these cells using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines.

### Path Construction Details:

- **Example 1 Analysis:**
  - Start at the red cell (2) at (2,1).
  - Horizontally extend grey cells to the right until reaching the column of the yellow cell (6,10).
  - Vertically extend grey cells down to reach the yellow cell.
  - From the yellow cell, extend vertically down to connect with the green cell (12,3).

- **Example 2 Analysis:**
  - Start at the green cell (3) at (1,5).
  - Vertically extend grey cells down to reach the row of the red cell (8,11).
  - From the red cell, extend grey cells horizontally left to connect with the yellow cell (10,2).

- **Example 3 Analysis:**
  - Start at the yellow cell (4) at (1,1).
  - Horizontally extend grey cells to right to reach the column of the green cell (4,12).
  - Vertically extend grey cells down to connect with the red cell (10,5).

- **Example 4 Analysis:**
  - Start at the red cell (2) at (5,2).
  - Horizontally extend grey cells to the right to reach the column of the yellow cell (1,10).
  - Vertically extend grey cells down to connect with the green cell (11,9).

### Application to Additional Input:

For the given additional input, the colored cells are located at:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

Applying the path construction strategy:
1. Start at the red cell (2) at (5,1), because it is the left-most.
2. Horizontally extend grey cells to the right to reach the column of the green cell (11,7).
3. Vertically extend grey cells down to connect with the green cell.
4. From the green cell, extend grey cells horizontally left to connect with the yellow cell (2,10).

This method should connect all colored cells with the shortest grey path.

Let's construct the output grid based on this path strategy:

- **Starting from red (5,1),** move horizontally to (5,7).
- **From (5,7),** move vertically down to the green (11,7).
- **From green (11,7),** move horizontally to (11,10).
- **Finally,** move vertically up to the yellow (2,10).

This approach will ensure all colored cells are connected correctly.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing both previous responses, let's identify the common misconception and correct it by re-examining the given examples:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Colored Cells:**
   - Each grid contains three distinct non-zero colored cells: red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).

2. **Output Grid:**
   - The positions of the colored cells are maintained.
   - Grey (5) cells are added to create paths that connect these colored cells.

3. **Path Analysis:**
   - The path of grey cells connects the colored cells in a sequential manner.
   - The grey path forms a continuous line that starts at one colored cell and connects to the others using the shortest possible paths, mainly vertical or horizontal lines.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:
- The rule is to connect all colored cells (2, 3, 4) with grey cells (5).
- The starting point for the path seems to rely on the left-most or top-most colored cell, and the path extends to connect the following colored cells in a way that minimizes the distance (least number of steps).

### Application to the Additional Input:
For the additional input:
- The positions of the colored cells are:
  - Red (2) at (5, 1)
  - Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
  - Green (3) at (11, 7)

A correct path can be constructed by:
1. **Starting from the left-most colored cell, which is Red (2) at (5, 1).**
2. Move vertically down to reach Green (3) at (11, 7).
3. From Green (3), move horizontally to reach Yellow (4) at (2, 10) by moving vertically to the corresponding row first if needed.

This path should be direct and minimal, ensuring that all colored cells are connected with grey cells (5) in a manner consistent with the examples.

Let's construct the correct output grid reflecting this strategy:

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses and reasoning through the examples again, let's clarify the transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has three distinct non-zero colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), and 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - The output retains the colored cells and connects them with a path of grey (5) cells.
   - The path starts from the red cell and connects to the yellow cell horizontally, then it connects the yellow to the green cell vertically.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), and 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - The grey path connects the green cell vertically to the red cell, and then the path extends horizontally from the red cell to the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), and 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - The grey path connects the yellow cell horizontally to the green cell, and then extends vertically from the green cell to the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - The input has 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), and 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - The grey path connects the yellow cell vertically to the red cell, then horizontally to the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves creating a path of grey (5) cells that connects the non-zero colored cells in the input grid. The path:
- Starts from one of the colored cells.
- Uses the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines to connect all colored cells.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule, we should:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1).
2. Move vertically to connect the red cell to the green cell.
3. From the green cell, move horizontally to connect to the yellow cell.

This path ensures all colored cells are connected using the shortest grey path possible.

### Correct Output for Additional Input:

- Start from the red cell (5,1).
- Move vertically downwards to (11,1).
- Move horizontally right to (11,7), reaching the green cell.
- Move horizontally to reach the yellow cell at (2,10).

This connection ensures all colored cells are connected with the shortest path following the observed pattern in the examples, correcting any misinterpretations in previous responses.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the examples again to understand the path construction between the colored cells.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has three non-zero colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - The output maintains these colored cells and introduces grey (5) cells connecting them.
   - The grey path starts from the red cell, extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally moves vertically to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), and 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, extends vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally back horizontally and vertically to connect with the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), and 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, extends horizontally to connect with the green cell, and then moves horizontally and vertically to connect with the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), and 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to connect with the red cell, and finally upwards to connect with the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero cells with grey (5) cells in a specific manner:
- The path of grey cells starts from one of the non-zero colored cells.
- The grey path connects these cells in a sequence by using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines.
- The rule seems to prioritize starting from the top-most or left-most color and connecting all colors sequentially.

### Application on Additional Test Input:

For the additional test input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

To apply the transformation rule:
1. Start from the red cell at (5,1).
2. Move vertically down to the green cell at (11,7).
3. From the green cell, move horizontally to the yellow cell at (2,10).

This grey path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a shortest possible sequence.

Let's correct the previous outputs by connecting the colors based on the observed path pattern:

- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Green (3) at (11,7)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)

Connect them with the shortest path of grey cells (5):
1. From red (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1).
2. Move horizontally from (11,1) to (11,7).
3. From (11,7), move vertically up to (2,7).
4. Move horizontally from (2,7) to (2,10).

This connection follows the adjacency rule observed in the examples.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Upon reviewing both previous responses, let's identify the common misconception and correct it by re-examining the given examples:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Colored Cells:**
   - Each grid contains three distinct non-zero colored cells: red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).

2. **Output Grid:**
   - The positions of the colored cells are maintained.
   - Grey (5) cells are added to create paths that connect these colored cells.

3. **Path Analysis:**
   - The path of grey cells connects the colored cells in a sequential manner.
   - The grey path forms a continuous line that starts at one colored cell and connects to the others using the shortest possible paths, mainly vertical or horizontal lines.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:
- The rule is to connect all colored cells (2, 3, 4) with grey cells (5).
- The starting point for the path seems to rely on the left-most or top-most colored cell, and the path extends to connect the following colored cells in a way that minimizes the distance (least number of steps).

### Application to the Additional Input:
For the additional input:
- The positions of the colored cells are:
  - Red (2) at (5, 1)
  - Yellow (4) at (2, 10)
  - Green (3) at (11, 7)

A correct path can be constructed by:
1. **Starting from the left-most colored cell, which is Red (2) at (5, 1).**
2. Move vertically down to reach Green (3) at (11, 7).
3. From Green (3), move horizontally to reach Yellow (4) at (2, 10) by moving vertically to the corresponding row first if needed.

This path should be direct and minimal, ensuring that all colored cells are connected with grey cells (5) in a manner consistent with the examples.

Let's construct the correct output grid reflecting this strategy:

</output>


Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, we must carefully analyze the examples and identify a consistent pattern in how the colored cells are connected by grey (5) cells in the output.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Red (2) at (2, 1), Yellow (4) at (6, 10), Green (3) at (11, 3).
   - Output: The path starts at Red (2), moves horizontally right, then vertically down to Yellow (4), and finally vertically to Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Green (3) at (1, 5), Red (2) at (8, 11), Yellow (4) at (10, 2).
   - Output: The path starts at Green (3), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and finally back to Yellow (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Yellow (4) at (1, 1), Green (3) at (4, 12), Red (2) at (10, 5).
   - Output: The path starts at Yellow (4), moves horizontally to Green (3), and then to Red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Yellow (4) at (1, 10), Red (2) at (5, 2), Green (3) at (11, 9).
   - Output: The path starts at Yellow (4), moves downwards, horizontally to Red (2), and upwards to Green (3).

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting all non-zero colored cells (2, 3, 4) with grey (5) cells, following these guidelines:
- The path starts from the top-leftmost non-zero cell.
- Connect these cells using the shortest possible sequence of horizontal and vertical lines.
- The path forms continuous segments that connect all colored cells.

### Application to the Additional Input:

For the additional input:
- Red (2) is at (5, 1)
- Yellow (4) is at (2, 10)
- Green (3) is at (11, 7)

Following the transformation rule:
1. Start from Red (2) at (5, 1).
2. Move vertically down to Green (3) at (11, 7).
3. Move horizontally right to Yellow (4) at (2, 10).

Construct the path to ensure the colored cells are connected with grey (5) cells.

**Correct Path Strategy:**
- Start from Red (2) at (5, 1).
- Move horizontally to (5, 7) to reach near Green (3).
- Move vertically down to (11, 7).
- From (11, 7), move horizontally to (11, 10).
- Finally, move vertically up to (2, 10) to reach Yellow (4).

This path follows the adjacency rule observed in the examples, ensuring all colored cells are connected.

Let's carefully analyze the examples to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations on the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has three colored cells: 2 (red) at (2,1), 4 (yellow) at (6,10), 3 (green) at (11,3).
   - Grey (5) cells create a path connecting these colors.
   - Path sequence: Start from red, move horizontally to the right, then move vertically downwards, finally connect to the yellow and green cells.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Colored cells: 3 (green) at (1,5), 2 (red) at (8,11), 4 (yellow) at (10,2).
   - Path sequence: Start from green, extend downwards, then horizontally to red, and finally to the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Colored cells: 4 (yellow) at (1,1), 3 (green) at (4,12), 2 (red) at (10,5).
   - Path sequence: Start from yellow, extend horizontally to connect to the green, then move to the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Colored cells: 4 (yellow) at (1,10), 2 (red) at (5,2), 3 (green) at (11,9).
   - Path sequence: Start from yellow, move vertically to red, and finally to the green.

### General Pattern:
The path always connects all colored cells with grey cells (5) in a sequence that minimizes the distance, using only horizontal and vertical lines. The starting point for the path is often the left-most or top-most colored cell, and it connects the other colored cells in a sequence.

### Application to Additional Input:
For the additional input, the positions of the distinct colors are:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

Based on the observed pattern:
1. **Start from the left-most or top-most colored cell**. Here, start from Red (2) at (5,1).
2. **Move vertically** from (5,1) to (11,1) to connect to Green (3) at (11,7).
3. **Move horizontally** from (11,1) to (11,7).
4. **Move vertically** from (11,7) to (2,7).
5. **Move horizontally** from (2,7) to (2,10) to connect to Yellow (4).

This sequence of moves ensures that all colored cells are connected with grey cells in a shortest possible path.

Now let's construct the output grid based on this strategy.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the given examples to determine the transformation rule for connecting the colored cells with grey cells (5).

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has red (2) at (2,1), yellow (4) at (6,10), and green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey cells (5) form a path starting from the red cell, extending horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally horizontally left to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has green (3) at (1,5), red (2) at (8,11), and yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, goes vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally extends to the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,1), green (3) at (4,12), and red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves horizontally to the green cell, and then vertically and horizontally to the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,10), red (2) at (5,2), and green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path initiates from the yellow cell, then vertically downwards to the red cell, and continues to the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero colored cells with grey (5) cells:
- The grey path starts from the top-most non-zero colored cell and connects these cells in a sequence using the shortest possible path (via horizontal and vertical lines).

### Application to the Additional Test Input:

For the additional input:
- The positions of the distinct colors are:
  - Red (2) at (5,1)
  - Yellow (4) at (2,10)
  - Green (3) at (11,7)

Following the observed pattern:
1. Start from the top-most colored cell, which is Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. From Yellow (4), move vertically down to the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move horizontally and then vertically to reach Green (3) at (11,7).

We'll now create the output grid based on this sequence.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To correct the previous outputs, let's carefully analyze the example transformations once more to fully understand the transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Colored Cell Positions:**
   - Each input grid contains exactly three non-zero colored cells: red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).
   - The positions of these colored cells remain unchanged in the output.

2. **Grey Path Formation:**
   - Grey cells (5) are added in the output to connect the colored cells.
   - The path connecting these colored cells is constructed using straight lines (horizontal or vertical) and forms a continuous path.

3. **Path Sequence:**
   - The starting point or order of connecting the colors is not strictly based on the colors themselves but rather seems to be determined by their positions (e.g., starting from the top-most cell or left-most cell).

### Path Analysis:

- In Example 1, the sequence seems to start from the red (2) cell, then extends to connect the yellow (4), and finally the green (3).
- In Example 2, the sequence starts with the green (3), moves to the red (2), and then to the yellow (4).
- In Example 3, it starts from the yellow (4), goes to the green (3), and ends at the red (2).
- In Example 4, it starts from the yellow (4), extends to the red (2), and ends at the green (3).

**Common Strategy:**
- The path always starts from one colored cell and creates a minimal path to connect all colored cells.
- The path seems to prioritize starting from the top-most or left-most non-zero colored cell and follows a path that minimizes the distance between these cells.
  
### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves:
1. Identifying the positions of red (2), green (3), and yellow (4) in the input grid.
2. Starting from the top-most or left-most colored cell, create a continuous path of grey (5) cells connecting all three colored cells with the shortest possible path using horizontal and vertical lines.

### Application to the Additional Test Input:

For the additional input:
- Red (2) is at (5, 1).
- Yellow (4) is at (2, 10).
- Green (3) is at (11, 7).

A correct path can be constructed by:
1. Starting from the left-most or top-most colored cell, which is Yellow (4) at (2, 10).
2. Move vertically down to reach Red (2) at (5, 1).
3. From Red (2), move vertically to reach Green (3) at (11, 7).

Thus, the path should maintain the minimal connection while covering all colored cells with grey cells (5).

Let's construct the correct output grid reflecting this strategy.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous attempts and the given examples, there appears to be a misunderstanding in the path construction between non-zero colored cells. Let's re-evaluate the transformation rules and examples carefully.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Non-zero cells: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Red (2), extends horizontally, then vertically down to Yellow (4), then vertically and horizontally to Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Non-zero cells: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Green (3), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and vertically and horizontally to Yellow (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), extends horizontally and vertically to Green (3), and then vertically and horizontally to Red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and vertically to Green (3).

### Revised Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- The path of grey cells (5) appears to connect non-zero cells sequentially.
- The first response attempted to connect the colors starting from the left-most colored cell; however, the examples suggest the path should start based on the order of the colors in terms of their appearance in the input.
- The path should connect these cells using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines. 

### Correction for Additional Test Input:

Given the test input:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

We should follow the pattern from the examples:
1. Start from the Yellow (4) at (2,10), as it appears first in the input.
2. Move vertically down to the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move vertically down to Green (3) at (11,7).

This path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a sequence that minimizes distance, consistent with the observed patterns in the examples.

Let's correct the path construction based on this refined understanding:
- Start at Yellow (4) at (2,10).
- Move from (2,10) vertically to (5,10) and then horizontally to (5,1) to reach Red (2).
- From (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1) and then horizontally to (11,7) to reach Green (3).

This revised path construction should accurately reflect the transformation rule observed in the examples.

Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the given examples to determine the transformation rule for connecting the colored cells with grey cells (5).

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has red (2) at (2,1), yellow (4) at (6,10), and green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey cells (5) form a path starting from the red cell, extending horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with the yellow cell, and finally horizontally left to connect with the green cell.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has green (3) at (1,5), red (2) at (8,11), and yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the green cell, goes vertically downwards, then horizontally to the red cell, and finally extends to the yellow cell.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,1), green (3) at (4,12), and red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the yellow cell, moves horizontally to the green cell, and then vertically and horizontally to the red cell.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,10), red (2) at (5,2), and green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path initiates from the yellow cell, then vertically downwards to the red cell, and continues to the green cell.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero colored cells with grey (5) cells:
- The grey path starts from the top-most non-zero colored cell and connects these cells in a sequence using the shortest possible path (via horizontal and vertical lines).

### Application to the Additional Test Input:

For the additional input:
- The positions of the distinct colors are:
  - Red (2) at (5,1)
  - Yellow (4) at (2,10)
  - Green (3) at (11,7)

Following the observed pattern:
1. Start from the top-most colored cell, which is Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. From Yellow (4), move vertically down to the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move horizontally and then vertically to reach Green (3) at (11,7).

We'll now create the output grid based on this sequence.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous attempts and the given examples, there appears to be a misunderstanding in the path construction between non-zero colored cells. Let's re-evaluate the transformation rules and examples carefully.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Non-zero cells: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Red (2), extends horizontally, then vertically down to Yellow (4), then vertically and horizontally to Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Non-zero cells: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Green (3), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and vertically and horizontally to Yellow (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), extends horizontally and vertically to Green (3), and then vertically and horizontally to Red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and vertically to Green (3).

### Revised Deduction of Transformation Rule:

- The path of grey cells (5) appears to connect non-zero cells sequentially.
- The first response attempted to connect the colors starting from the left-most colored cell; however, the examples suggest the path should start based on the order of the colors in terms of their appearance in the input.
- The path should connect these cells using the shortest possible horizontal and vertical lines. 

### Correction for Additional Test Input:

Given the test input:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

We should follow the pattern from the examples:
1. Start from the Yellow (4) at (2,10), as it appears first in the input.
2. Move vertically down to the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move vertically down to Green (3) at (11,7).

This path will ensure all colored cells are connected in a sequence that minimizes distance, consistent with the observed patterns in the examples.

Let's correct the path construction based on this refined understanding:
- Start at Yellow (4) at (2,10).
- Move from (2,10) vertically to (5,10) and then horizontally to (5,1) to reach Red (2).
- From (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1) and then horizontally to (11,7) to reach Green (3).

This revised path construction should accurately reflect the transformation rule observed in the examples.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the examples systematically.

### Observations:
1. **Example 1:**
   - Colored cells: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - The path of grey cells (5) begins from the Red (2) cell, extends horizontally to the right until it aligns vertically with the Yellow (4) cell, then descends vertically to reach the Yellow (4), and finally moves horizontally left to reach the Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Colored cells: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path starts from the Green (3) at (1,5), goes vertically down, slightly detours horizontally to reach the Red (2) at (8,11), and finally goes vertically down to reach the Yellow (4) at (10,2).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Colored cells: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path starts from the Yellow (4) at (1,1), extends horizontally to the Green (3) at (4,12), then moves vertically down to reach the Red (2) at (10,5).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Colored cells: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path initiates from the Yellow (4), goes vertically down to the Red (2), and finally extends horizontally to reach the Green (3).

### Common Pattern:
- The grey path connects the non-zero colored cells in the sequence they appear, using the shortest path with horizontal and vertical lines.

### Applying the Transformation Rule:
For the additional test input:
- Identify positions of colored cells: Red (2) at (5,1), Yellow (4) at (2,10), Green (3) at (11,7).
- Follow the pattern of connecting these points:
  1. Start from the Yellow (4) at (2,10).
  2. Move vertically down to align with the Red (2) at (5,1).
  3. From Red (2), move horizontally to reach the Green (3) at (11,7).

Now, let's construct this path on the grid for the additional test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully re-examine the examples to deduce the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input non-zero cells: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Red (2), extends horizontally to the right, then vertically down to Yellow (4), and finally horizontally left to connect with Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input non-zero cells: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Green (3), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and finally extends to Yellow (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves horizontally to Green (3), and then vertically and horizontally to Red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input non-zero cells: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves vertically down, horizontally to Red (2), and vertically to Green (3).

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The transformation rule involves connecting the non-zero colored cells with grey (5) cells:
- The grey path starts from the top-most non-zero colored cell and connects these cells in a sequence using the shortest possible path (via horizontal and vertical lines).

### Application to the Additional Test Input:

For the additional input:
- The positions of the distinct colors are:
  - Red (2) at (5,1)
  - Yellow (4) at (2,10)
  - Green (3) at (11,7)

Following the observed pattern:
1. Start from the top-most colored cell, which is Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. From Yellow (4), move vertically down to the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move vertically down to Green (3) at (11,7).

To ensure the shortest path:
- Start at Yellow (4) at (2,10).
- Move vertically downwards to (5,10).
- Then move horizontally left to (5,1) to reach Red (2).
- From (5,1), move vertically down to (11,1).
- Finally, move horizontally right to (11,7) to reach Green (3).

This path construction should accurately reflect the transformation rule observed in the examples.

Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing both previous responses, it seems that the understanding of how to construct the grey path (5) connecting the colored cells is incorrect. Let's re-examine the examples to deduce the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - Grey path connects Red (2) to Yellow (4) and then to Green (3) by first extending horizontally from Red, then vertically down to Yellow, and finally vertically and horizontally to Green.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - Grey path starts from Green, goes vertically to Red, and then continues to Yellow.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - Grey path starts at Yellow, moves horizontally to Green, and then vertically and horizontally to Red.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - Grey path starts at Yellow, moves vertically to Red, and then continues to Green.

### Deduction of Transformation Rule:

The pattern observed is that the grey path (5) follows a specific order for connecting the colored cells:
- The path starts at the top-most non-zero colored cell.
- It connects the cells in a sequence that minimizes the use of grey cells to connect all the colors.
- The path consists of horizontal and vertical lines, ensuring connectivity between the starting point and the subsequent points.

### Application to the Additional Test Input:

For the additional input:
- Red (2) at (5,1)
- Yellow (4) at (2,10)
- Green (3) at (11,7)

Following the observed pattern:
1. Start from the top-most colored cell, which is Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. From Yellow (4), move vertically down to reach the Red (2) at (5,1).
3. From Red (2), move horizontally and then vertically to connect to Green (3) at (11,7).

We'll now create the output grid based on this corrected sequence. The path should be constructed with minimal use of grey cells, and should follow the observed sequence in the examples.

The task is to determine the transformation rule that connects distinct colored cells (non-zero) in the input grid with grey cells (5) in the output grid. Let's carefully analyze the examples to derive this transformation rule.

### Analysis of Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Colored cells: Red (2) at (2,1), Yellow (4) at (6,10), Green (3) at (11,3).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Red (2), moves horizontally to the right, then vertically down to connect with Yellow (4), and finally horizontally left to connect with Green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Colored cells: Green (3) at (1,5), Red (2) at (8,11), Yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Green (3), moves vertically downwards, then horizontally to Red (2), and finally vertically and horizontally to Yellow (4).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Colored cells: Yellow (4) at (1,1), Green (3) at (4,12), Red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves horizontally to Green (3), and then vertically down and horizontally to Red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Colored cells: Yellow (4) at (1,10), Red (2) at (5,2), Green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path (5) starts from Yellow (4), moves vertically down to Red (2), and continues horizontally and vertically to Green (3).

### Deductions

- The grey path always starts from the top-most non-zero colored cell.
- The path uses horizontal and vertical lines to connect all non-zero colored cells in the order of their vertical appearance.
- The path connects these cells with the shortest possible route using only right, down, left, and up directions.

### Application to the Additional Test Input

For the additional input:
- The positions of the distinct colors are:
  - Yellow (4) at (2,10)
  - Red (2) at (5,1)
  - Green (3) at (11,7)

Step-by-step path construction:
1. Start from the top-most Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. Move vertically down to (5,10).
3. Move horizontally left to (5,1) to connect with Red (2).
4. Move vertically down from (5,1) to (11,1).
5. Move horizontally right to (11,7) to connect with Green (3).

This path construction accurately reflects the transformation rule derived from the examples.

Let's re-evaluate the transformation rule by examining the provided example inputs and outputs.

### Observations from the Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has red (2) at (2,1), yellow (4) at (6,10), and green (3) at (11,3).
   - The output shows that grey cells (5) form a path:
     - Starts from red (2) at (2,1), extends horizontally to (2,10).
     - Moves vertically from (2,10) to (6,10) to meet yellow (4).
     - Then goes vertically from (6,10) to (6,3), and horizontally to green (3).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has green (3) at (1,5), red (2) at (8,11), and yellow (4) at (10,2).
   - The grey path:
     - Starts from green (3) at (1,5) and goes vertically down to (8,5).
     - Moves horizontally to (8,11) to meet red (2).
     - Then goes vertically to (10,11) and moves horizontally to yellow (4) at (10,2).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,1), green (3) at (4,12), and red (2) at (10,5).
   - The grey path:
     - Starts from yellow (4) at (1,1), moves horizontally to (1,12).
     - Moves vertically to (4,12) to meet green (3).
     - Then vertically down to (10,12), and horizontally to red (2).

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has yellow (4) at (1,10), red (2) at (5,2), and green (3) at (11,9).
   - The grey path starts from yellow (4) and moves vertically down to (5,10).
   - Moves horizontally to red (2) at (5,2).
   - Then moves vertically to (11,2), and horizontally to green (3).

### Deduction of Transformation Rule

Each path:
- Starts from the top-most color cell, which is determined by the row position (top to bottom).
- Connects the colored cells using vertical and horizontal paths.
- The path order is based on the vertical position of the cells, i.e., starts from the top-most colored cell and progresses to the lowest.

### Application to the Additional Test Input

For the additional test input:
- The positions of the colored cells are:
  - Yellow (4) at (2,10)
  - Red (2) at (5,1)
  - Green (3) at (11,7)

Following the pattern:
1. Start from Yellow (4) at (2,10).
2. Create a path vertically down from (2,10) to (5,10).
3. Move horizontally to (5,1) to reach Red (2).
4. From Red (2), move vertically down to (11,1).
5. Move horizontally to (11,7) to reach Green (3).

Constructing this path ensures that we connect the cells while traversing from top to bottom.

We'll now create the output grid based on this correct path sequence.

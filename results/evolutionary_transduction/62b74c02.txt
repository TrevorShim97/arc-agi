========== SYSTEM PROMPT ==========

You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids." A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers (list[list[int]] in python code). Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output. You must resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule before returning the predicted output grid. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. As another example, if some shape(s) or cells in the input are relocated or recolored, you need to determine which exact shapes should be relocated/recolored in the output and where they should be moved or what their color in the output should be. Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before returning the predicted output grid. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step-by-step reasoning.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1-cell holes are filled with pink, 2-cell holes are filled with blue, and 3-cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before returning the predicted output grid.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, return the predicted output grid enclosed in <output></output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. DO NOT include any other text or code within the <output> tags except for the output grid.

You might also be provided with an incorrect output grid that you've returned for these examples during a previous attempt. If you are provided with an incorrect previous answer, you should carefully read through its reasoning to figure out what went wrong and return a corrected output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's analyze the transformation for each given example to determine the rule.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
[[8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
**Output:**
```
[[8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],
 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1],
 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
```
- The first three columns of the input are preserved in the output.
- The subsequent columns, which were zeros, are filled with the colors from the first three columns repeated. The pattern repeats until the grid width is filled.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
[[3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
**Output:**
```
[[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
 [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
```
- The first three columns are preserved.
- The zeros are replaced with a repetition of the first three columns' colors.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
**Output:**
```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
```
- Again, the first four columns are preserved.
- The zeros are replaced by repetitions of these first four columns.

### General Rule:
1. The first few columns of the input are preserved in the output.
2. The zeros in the input are replaced by repeating the initial columns' pattern across the rest of the grid.

For the additional input, we will apply this rule.

### Additional Input:
```
[[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
- The first four columns are preserved.
- The zeros are replaced by repeating these initial columns.

Let's construct the output accordingly.

 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
```

- The input grid is 3x10 and the output grid is 3x10.
- The first three columns of the output grid are identical to the input grid.
- The last column of the output grid is a copy of the first column of the input grid.
- The middle columns (4th to 9th) in the output are filled with the values of the first column of the input grid.

**Example 2:**

```
[[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
 [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
```

- The first three columns of the output grid match the input grid.
- The last column is a copy of the first column of the input grid.
- The middle columns (4th to 10th) are filled with the values of the first column from the input grid.

**Example 3:**

```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Output:
```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
```

- The first four columns of the output grid match the input grid.
- The last column is a copy of the first column of the input grid.
- The middle columns (5th to 11th) are filled with the values of the first column from the input grid.

**Pattern Summary:**
- The output grid's first few columns are identical to the input grid.
- The last column of the output grid is a copy of the first column of the input grid.
- The middle columns are filled with the values from the first column of the input grid.

**Transformation Rule:**
1. The output grid's first 'n' columns are identical to the input grid's first 'n' columns.
2. The last column of the output grid is a copy of the first column of the input grid.
3. The middle columns between 'n+1' to 'm-1' (where 'm' is the number of columns in the output) are filled with the values of the first column of the input grid.

**Application to New Input:**

Input:
```
[[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

The first four columns of the output will be identical to the input. The last column will be a copy of the first column. The middle columns (5th to 11th) will be filled with the values from the first column. The output grid will be 4x14.

Let's apply it to generate the output.
</reasoning>

 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]]
</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples and identify any patterns or rules that are consistently applied to transform the input grid into the output grid.

### Analyzing Example 1:
Input Grid:
```
[[8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output Grid:
```
[[8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],
 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1],
 [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
```
- The initial pattern (up to the first 3 non-zero columns) is preserved.
- The rest of the row (7 columns, 0s in the input) are filled with a pattern.
- The pattern consists of the last non-zero column value (except the last column, which repeats the second column value).

### Analyzing Example 2:
Input Grid:
```
[[3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output Grid:
```
[[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
 [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
 [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
```
- Following the same pattern as Example 1, the last non-zero column value fills the middle section.
- The last column repeats the second column value.

### Analyzing Example 3:
Input Grid:
```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
Output Grid:
```
[[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
 [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
```
- The same pattern is observed: the last non-zero column value fills the middle section.
- The last column repeats the second column value.

### Deduced Transformation Rule:
1. Identify the non-zero segment of each row.
2. For each row, extend the grid by:
   - Filling the middle section with the last non-zero value from that row.
   - Ending the row with the second non-zero value from that row.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
Test Input:
```
[[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
- For each row, use the transformation rule to fill the middle section and repeat the second column value at the end.

Output for Test Input:
```
[[3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2],
 [1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]]
```

 [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]]
</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     [[8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [[8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],
      [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1],
      [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
     ```

   - Observations:
     - The first three elements of each row are the same in both input and output.
     - The trailing zeros in each row of the input are replaced by a repeated pattern of the third element in the row, followed by the second, and then the third element again.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [[3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
      [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
      [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
      [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
     ```

   - Observations:
     - Similar pattern as Example 1. The first three elements of each row are retained.
     - Trailing zeros are replaced with the third element repeating, followed by the second, and the third element again.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     [[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output:
     ```
     [[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
      [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
      [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
     ```

   - Observations:
     - Again, the first four elements of each row are retained.
     - Trailing zeros are replaced with the fourth element repeating, followed by the third, second, and first elements.

**Conclusion on Transformation Rule:**
- For each row in the input, retain the initial non-zero sequence.
- Replace trailing zeros with a sequence of the last non-zero element repeated, followed by the elements in reverse order (excluding the first one) until the last non-zero element is reached again.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

**Additional Test Input:**
```
[[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Using the rule:
- For the first row: Start with `[3, 8, 8, 3]` and then fill with `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3]`.
- For the second row: Start with `[2, 1, 1, 2]` and then fill with `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]`.
- For the third row: Start with `[1, 3, 3, 1]` and then fill with `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1]`.
- For the fourth row: Start with `[2, 1, 1, 2]` and then fill with `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]`.

Let's create the output grid based on these transformations.

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  [[8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  [[8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],
   [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1],
   [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
  ```

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  [[3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  [[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
   [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
   [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
   [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
  ```

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  [[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  [[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
   [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
   [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
  ```

**Analysis:**
- Each input grid has some rows that start with non-zero numbers followed by zeroes. The output grid has the same initial non-zero numbers, but then the zeroes are replaced.
- The length of the output row equals the initial non-zero segment length doubled, minus one.
- The pattern observed is that the initial non-zero numbers are extended to fill the row in the same sequence they appear initially, then repeated in reverse order.
- Specifically, for each row:
  - Take the initial non-zero sequence.
  - Extend it by repeating the sequence and then reversing it.
  - This can be seen as mirroring the sequence about the center of the row.

**Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify the initial non-zero segment in each row.
2. Extend the row by mirroring this segment to create the output row.

**Applying to the Additional Input:**
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- Each row has an initial segment that we will mirror:
  - Row 1: [3, 8, 8, 3] -> Output: [3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 3]
  - Row 2: [2, 1, 1, 2] -> Output: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]
  - Row 3: [1, 3, 3, 1] -> Output: [1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1]
  - Row 4: [2, 1, 1, 2] -> Output: [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]

We now apply this rule to generate the output for the additional input.

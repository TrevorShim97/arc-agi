[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

In Example 1:
- The input grid has various colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) scattered throughout mostly zero-valued cells.
- The output grid appears to have the same colored cells, but they are shifted to the right.
- Specifically, each group of colored cells shifts to the right until it is as far right as it can go without changing the row.

In Example 2:
- Similarly, the input grid has colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
- In the output, the colored cells are again shifted to the rightmost position possible on their respective rows.

In Example 3:
- The input grid contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
- In the output, each group of colored cells is shifted to the rightmost position in its respective row.

From these observations, the transformation rule becomes clear: For each row in the input grid, shift all colored cells to the rightmost possible position while preserving their order within the row.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the additional test input:

Additional Input:
- Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]
- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
- Row 2: [2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]
- Row 3: [2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]
- Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
- Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
- Row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
- Row 7: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]
- Row 8: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]
- Row 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Thus, the output for the additional input should be the grid with each row's colored cells shifted to the rightmost position.

Response: <reasoning>

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 8],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

In Example 1, the colored blocks appear to be shifted to the right. For instance:
- The "2" block is shifted from columns 2-3 to columns 9-10.
- The "5" block is shifted from columns 7-8 to columns 11-12.
- The "3" block is shifted from columns 4-5 to columns 11-12.
- The "6" block is shifted from columns 1-2 to columns 10-11.
- The "8" block is shifted from column 6 to column 12.

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
   [0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
   [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6]]
  ```

In Example 2, similar right-shifting is observed:
- The "3" block moves from the first column to the fourth column.
- The "2" blocks move from the third column to the fifth column.
- The "8" block moves from the second column to the fourth column.
- The "6" block moves from the first column to the fourth column.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
   [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
  ```

Similarly:
- The "2" block from columns 1-2 is shifted to columns 4-5.
- The "6" block is shifted from column 0 to column 4.
- The "3" block is shifted from column 4 to column 5.
- The "8" block is shifted from column 2 to column 4 or 5.

### Conclusion:
The transformation involves shifting colored blocks from left to right within their respective rows. The exact amount of shift seems to be determined by moving the colored blocks to the rightmost position available within the row, without wrapping around the grid.

For the additional test input, we will apply the same rule: shift each colored block in a row to the rightmost available position.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the new input.

[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 2],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's observe the inputs and outputs in the given examples.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- Input and Output are both 10x13 grids.
- Observing the transformation:
  - In the input, the first non-zero block (2s) starts at position (1, 2) and (1, 3).
  - In the output, this block of 2s is shifted to (1, 9) and (1, 10).
  - Similarly, each block of non-zero numbers in the input is shifted to the right while maintaining the row position.
  - The shift in horizontal position seems to be by 7 columns to the right.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- Input and Output are both 6x6 grids.
- Observing the transformation:
  - In the input, the first non-zero block (3s) starts at position (0, 1) and (1, 1).
  - In the output, this block of 3s is shifted to (0, 4) and (1, 4).
  - Each block in the input grid is shifted 4 columns to the right in the output.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- Input and Output are both 6x6 grids.
- Observing the transformation:
  - In the input, the first block of 2s starts at (0, 1) and (0, 2).
  - In the output, this block of 2s is shifted to (0, 4) and (0, 5).
  - Each block in the input grid is shifted 4 columns to the right in the output.

**General Observations:**
- In Examples 2 and 3, the non-zero blocks are shifted 4 columns to the right.
- In Example 1, the shift is 7 columns to the right.
- It seems the shift is dependent on the width of the grid, specifically shifting to the end of the grid, but keeping within bounds.

**Hypothesis for Transformation Rule:**
- For each non-zero block in the input, shift the block horizontally as far right as possible without changing the row, ensuring it stays within the grid bounds.

### Determine Shift for Additional Input:
The additional input is a 10x10 grid.
- For this grid, we can observe that the shift should be 5 columns to the right, similar to how in the 6x6 grids the shift was 4 columns, and for the 10x13 grid, it was 7 columns.

**Transformation Rule:**
- Identify all non-zero blocks in the input grid.
- Shift each block to the rightmost possible position in the same row while keeping them within grid bounds.

Applying this rule to the additional test input (10x10 grid):

- Shift all blocks 5 columns to the right.

### Applying the Rule:
1. Identify non-zero blocks in each row.
2. Move these blocks 5 columns to the right.
3. Ensure the blocks do not exceed the grid boundaries.

Let's apply this reasoning to the additional input grid.

Response: <reasoning>

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8).
  - Each shape is isolated without touching others.
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - For instance, the "2" shape moved from columns 2-3 to 9-10.
  - The "5" shape moved from columns 7-8 to 11-12.

### Example 2:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - The "3" shape moved from columns 0-1 to 4-5.
  - The "2" shape moved from columns 3-4 to 4-5.
  - The "6" shape moved from column 0 to 3.

### Example 3:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - The "2" shape moved from columns 1-2 to 4-5.
  - The "6" shape moved from column 0 to 4.
  - The "8" shape moved from column 2 to 4.

### Analysis:
The transformation rule seems to involve shifting each colored shape to the right. The amount of shift is determined by the distance required to move the shape from its original position to the right edge of the grid or another position. The exact shift varies between examples, but the common factor is the movement to the right.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to shift each shape to the rightmost possible position within its row, without altering its shape or crossing into another shape's space. This is substantiated by the consistent rightward movement across all examples.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples to identify the pattern:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: The grid contains scattered numbers (2, 3, 5, 6, 8), mostly along the left and towards the middle of the grid.
   - Output: The numbers are shifted towards the right side of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Similar to Example 1, numbers are distributed with some at the leftmost column.
   - Output: The numbers are shifted to the right, maintaining their row but moving to the rightmost possible position.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Numbers are distributed and not aligned to a single column.
   - Output: Numbers are shifted towards the rightmost side, again maintaining their row.

**Observation:**
From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves shifting each non-zero number (representing colors) as far right as possible within their respective rows. This means:

- For each row, all non-zero values are moved to fill the rightmost available spaces, preserving their original order.
- The number of zeros in each row remains the same but shifts to the left to accommodate the rightward movement of non-zero numbers.

**Transformation Rule:**
1. Iterate through each row of the grid.
2. Extract all non-zero values from the row.
3. Calculate the number of zeros needed to fill the row to its original length (total length minus the number of non-zero values).
4. Construct the new row with the zeros on the left followed by the extracted non-zero values on the right.
5. Replace the original row with this newly constructed row.

Let's apply this rule to the additional input grid:

Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Applying the rule:

1. Row 1: Move [8, 2] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2].
2. Row 2: Move [2, 2] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2].
3. Row 3: Move [2, 3, 3, 3] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3].
4. Row 4: Move [2, 4, 4] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4].
5. Row 5: Move [4, 4, 4] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4].
6. Row 6: Move [8] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8].
7. Row 7: Move [6] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6].
8. Row 8: Move [8, 6] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6].
9. Row 9: Move [5, 5] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5].
10. Row 10: Move [8] to the right: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8].

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

In Example 1:
- The input grid has various colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, and 8) scattered throughout mostly zero-valued cells.
- The output grid appears to have the same colored cells, but they are shifted to the right.
- Specifically, each group of colored cells shifts to the right until it is as far right as it can go without changing the row.

In Example 2:
- Similarly, the input grid has colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
- In the output, the colored cells are again shifted to the rightmost position possible on their respective rows.

In Example 3:
- The input grid contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
- In the output, each group of colored cells is shifted to the rightmost position in its respective row.

From these observations, the transformation rule becomes clear: For each row in the input grid, shift all colored cells to the rightmost possible position while preserving their order within the row.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the additional test input:

Additional Input:
- Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]
- Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
- Row 2: [2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]
- Row 3: [2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]
- Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
- Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
- Row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
- Row 7: [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]
- Row 8: [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]
- Row 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

Thus, the output for the additional input should be the grid with each row's colored cells shifted to the rightmost position.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>

To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

### Example 1:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8).
  - Each shape is isolated without touching others.
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - For instance, the "2" shape moved from columns 2-3 to 9-10.
  - The "5" shape moved from columns 7-8 to 11-12.

### Example 2:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - The "3" shape moved from columns 0-1 to 4-5.
  - The "2" shape moved from columns 3-4 to 4-5.
  - The "6" shape moved from column 0 to 3.

### Example 3:
- **Input**:
  - The grid contains several colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**:
  - The same shapes appear in the output, but they are shifted to the right.
  - The "2" shape moved from columns 1-2 to 4-5.
  - The "6" shape moved from column 0 to 4.
  - The "8" shape moved from column 2 to 4.

### Analysis:
The transformation rule seems to involve shifting each colored shape to the right. The amount of shift is determined by the distance required to move the shape from its original position to the right edge of the grid or another position. The exact shift varies between examples, but the common factor is the movement to the right.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to shift each shape to the rightmost possible position within its row, without altering its shape or crossing into another shape's space. This is substantiated by the consistent rightward movement across all examples.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

</reasoning>

    output_grid = [[0] * len(input_grid[0]) for _ in range(len(input_grid))]

        colors = [cell for cell in row if cell != 0]
        if colors:
            start_index = len(row) - len(colors)
            output_grid[i][start_index:start_index + len(colors)] = colors
    return output_grid

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
</output>


Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing both previous responses, it's apparent that the issue lies in the interpretation of the transformation rule. Let's break down the examples again to identify the correct rule.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: Colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) are scattered.
- **Output**: These cells are shifted to the rightmost possible position within their respective rows. Importantly, they maintain their row and order within the row.

### Example 2:
- **Input**: Contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**: Similar rightward shift of colored cells, maintaining the row and order.

### Example 3:
- **Input**: Colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**: Again, cells are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows.

The consistency across these examples is the movement of colored cells to the rightmost positions in their rows without switching rows or altering the order within the row. 

### Observations:
1. Colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows.
2. The order of colored cells within a row is preserved.
3. The number of zeros on the left increases as the non-zero elements are shifted right.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost possible position within the row, preserving their order.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

### Application to Additional Input:
- Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
- Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
- Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
- Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
- Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
- Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
- Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
- Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
- Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
- Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The corrected output grid should reflect the above transformations.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-analyze the given examples and the previous responses to identify any mistakes in the reasoning.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes with colors 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost possible position in its respective row.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes with colors 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - **Output:** As with Example 1, each shape is shifted to the rightmost position possible within its row.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes with colors 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - **Output:** Again, each shape is shifted to the rightmost position possible within its row.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row, while maintaining its order within the row.

### Analysis of Previous Responses:
- Both responses identified the rightward shift but failed to correctly apply it to the additional test input.
- The mistakes were in misplacing the colors when applying the rightward shift.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`

4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the provided examples and previous responses, the transformation rule can be deduced more accurately:

### Observations:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains colored cells scattered in a grid.
   - Output: The colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position possible within their respective rows.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains colored cells scattered in a grid.
   - Output: Similarly, the colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position possible within their respective rows.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains colored cells scattered in a grid.
   - Output: Again, the colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position possible within their respective rows.

### Common Transformation Pattern:
For each row in the input grid, the transformation involves:
- Identifying non-zero (colored) cells.
- Shifting all of these non-zero cells to the rightmost side of the row, preserving their internal order.

### Applying the Pattern to Additional Input:
By applying the above deduced transformation pattern, the additional test input should be transformed as follows:

1. **Row 0:** [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]
2. **Row 1:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
3. **Row 2:** [2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]
4. **Row 3:** [2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]
5. **Row 4:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
6. **Row 5:** [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
7. **Row 6:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
8. **Row 7:** [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]
9. **Row 8:** [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]
10. **Row 9:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

The transformation involves shifting each row's colored cells to the rightmost side, preserving the order within each row. This matches the pattern identified in the given examples.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs again:

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
   - Colored shapes are present (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) in the input.
   - Each colored shape in the input is shifted to the right in the output, but they maintain their row position.
   - The rule seems to be shifting colored shapes to the rightmost possible position in their respective rows.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Again, the input and output grids have the same dimensions.
   - Colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8) in the input are each shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows in the output.
   - The transformation consistently involves moving each colored shape to the rightmost position possible without changing its order within the row.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Similar to the previous examples, colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8) in the input are shifted rightwards in the output.
   - The output consistently shows each shape shifted to the rightmost position in its row.

### Consistent Transformation Rule:
Across all examples, the transformation rule involves shifting each colored shape to the rightmost possible position in its respective row. The shapes should maintain their order within the row and should not overlap with each other or extend beyond the row's boundary.

### Applying the Rule to the Additional Input:
1. **Row 0:** [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]
2. **Row 1:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]
3. **Row 2:** [2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]
4. **Row 3:** [2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]
5. **Row 4:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]
6. **Row 5:** [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]
7. **Row 6:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]
8. **Row 7:** [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]
9. **Row 8:** [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]
10. **Row 9:** [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> Shift to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]

The key is to ensure that the shapes maintain their internal order and that each shape is moved as far right as possible without exceeding the row boundary. 

Let's correct the output based on this refined understanding.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the examples provided, the transformation rule becomes clearer with a closer look:

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - The input grid has various colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, and 8).
   - The output grid shifts non-zero values to the rightmost position in their respective rows, maintaining the sequence of colors.

2. **Example 2**:
   - The input grid has colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
   - The output grid displays a rightmost shift of non-zero values in each row, preserving color order.

3. **Example 3**:
   - The input grid contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, and 8).
   - In the output, each row's non-zero values are shifted to the rightmost positions while maintaining their sequence.

### Pattern Identification:
- The transformation rule is consistent across all examples: For each row, non-zero values are shifted to the rightmost available positions within the row without changing the order of these values.

### Correction of Past Responses:
- In the previous responses, the implementation of shifting non-zero values was incorrect in terms of the exact outcome, particularly concerning maintaining the order of the colored values when shifted to the rightmost positions.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
- For each row in the input grid:
  1. Identify all non-zero values.
  2. Shift these non-zero values to the rightmost positions within the row, preserving their initial order.
  3. Ensure the rest of the row is filled with zeros on the left.

Now, applying this rule to the additional test input will yield the correct output.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Upon reviewing both previous responses, it's apparent that the issue lies in the interpretation of the transformation rule. Let's break down the examples again to identify the correct rule.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: Colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) are scattered.
- **Output**: These cells are shifted to the rightmost possible position within their respective rows. Importantly, they maintain their row and order within the row.

### Example 2:
- **Input**: Contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**: Similar rightward shift of colored cells, maintaining the row and order.

### Example 3:
- **Input**: Colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
- **Output**: Again, cells are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows.

The consistency across these examples is the movement of colored cells to the rightmost positions in their rows without switching rows or altering the order within the row. 

### Observations:
1. Colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows.
2. The order of colored cells within a row is preserved.
3. The number of zeros on the left increases as the non-zero elements are shifted right.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost possible position within the row, preserving their order.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

### Application to Additional Input:
- Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
- Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
- Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
- Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
- Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
- Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
- Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
- Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
- Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
- Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The corrected output grid should reflect the above transformations.

To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-analyze the given examples and the previous responses to identify any mistakes in the reasoning.

### Observations from Examples:

   - **Input:** Contains shapes with colors 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 scattered throughout the grid.

   - **Input:** Contains shapes with colors 2, 3, 6, and 8.
   - **Output:** Again, each shape is shifted to the rightmost position possible within its row.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row, while maintaining its order within the row.

### Analysis of Previous Responses:
- Both responses identified the rightward shift but failed to correctly apply it to the additional test input.
- The mistakes were in misplacing the colors when applying the rightward shift.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`

5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

This correct transformation should ensure that all colored cells are moved to their rightmost positions without changing the order within the row.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully re-examine each example to determine the correct transformation rule, as the previous responses failed to produce the correct outputs.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost possible position in its respective row. Importantly, the order of shapes within each row is preserved.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Similar rightward shift of colored shapes, maintaining the row and order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Again, shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row, while maintaining its order within the row. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost position for each row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the provided examples to determine the transformation rule correctly.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored cells (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored cell is shifted to the rightmost possible position in its respective row, maintaining the order of colored cells as they appear.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Each colored cell is shifted to the rightmost position within its row, maintaining the order of colored cells.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored cells (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Again, colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position possible within their respective rows.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each row's colored cells are shifted to the rightmost position possible, while maintaining their original order within the row.

### Previous Mistakes:
In both previous responses, the transformation rule was correctly identified, but there was a mistake in applying the order preservation for some rows. The rule should strictly preserve the order of colored cells as they appear in the input when shifting them to the rightmost positions.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify all non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, preserving their original order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

This corrected transformation should ensure that all colored cells are moved to their rightmost positions without changing the order within the row.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Both previous responses identified the transformation rule correctly: for each row, non-zero elements should be shifted to the rightmost possible position while preserving their order. However, there is an error in the application of this rule. Specifically, the error lies in the misplacement of the transformed rows in the output grid.

To identify the correct transformation, let's re-evaluate the examples:

### Example Analysis

- **Example 1:**
  - **Input Row 1:** `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - **Output Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]`

  The non-zero elements `2, 2` are shifted to the rightmost position in the row.

- **Example 2:**
  - **Input Row 1:** `[0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0]`
  - **Output Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2]`

  The non-zero elements `3, 2` are shifted to the rightmost position in the row.

- **Example 3:**
  - **Input Row 1:** `[6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
  - **Output Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2]`

  The non-zero elements `6, 2` are shifted to the rightmost position in the row.

### Consistent Pattern
The transformation involves shifting non-zero numbers to the rightmost position within their row, preserving their order and ensuring that zeros fill the remaining left positions.

### Application to Additional Input
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input. Each row of the input is processed individually, shifting non-zero numbers to the rightmost possible position:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

By ensuring that the application of the transformation rule is consistent, we avoid the errors seen in previous responses.

Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses and the paired examples, it's clear that the task involves shifting colored cells to the rightmost position within their respective rows while preserving their order. However, there is an inconsistency noted in the previous outputs, particularly with the handling of the additional test input.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Colors (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) appear scattered.
   - **Output:** Each color is shifted to the rightmost position available in its row.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Colors (2, 3, 6, 8) are present.
   - **Output:** Similar shifting of colors to the rightmost position while maintaining their order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Colors (2, 3, 6, 8) appear.
   - **Output:** Colors shifted to the rightmost position in each row, maintaining order.

### Consistency:
The rule is consistent across examples: Shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost position in the row, maintaining their order.

### Analysis of Previous Mistakes:
The previous responses incorrectly shifted some elements or placed them in a wrong order. For instance, the response incorrectly placed zeros between shifted non-zero elements.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify all non-zero elements, shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row while maintaining their original order, and fill the remaining positions with zeros on the left.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's re-examine the examples and derive the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

- In each example, the transformation involves moving non-zero elements to the rightmost position in their respective rows while maintaining their order.

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: Various non-zero numbers scattered.
- **Output**: Non-zero numbers are shifted to the rightmost part of their respective rows.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: Similar pattern with different positions of non-zero numbers.
- **Output**: Again, non-zero numbers are shifted to the rightmost part of their respective rows.

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: Contains different non-zero numbers.
- **Output**: Non-zero numbers are shifted to the rightmost part of their respective rows.

### Consistent Pattern:
In all examples, non-zero numbers in each row are shifted to the rightmost position while maintaining their order.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, move all non-zero elements to the rightmost position within the row, preserving their order.

### Application to Additional Input:

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Let's carefully re-examine each example to determine the correct transformation rule, as the previous responses failed to produce the correct outputs.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost possible position in its respective row. Importantly, the order of shapes within each row is preserved.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Similar rightward shift of colored shapes, maintaining the row and order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Again, shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row, while maintaining its order within the row. This suggests that the transformation involves shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost position for each row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

Ensure that the shift is executed correctly and the order is preserved.

 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]]
</output>


Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses, it seems the main misunderstanding was in the execution of the shifting operation. Let's go through the examples carefully again to identify the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost position in its respective row. Importantly, the order of shapes within each row is preserved.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost position in its respective row, with the order preserved.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is shifted to the rightmost position in its respective row, while maintaining order.

### Key Insight:
In the previous responses, there was a mistake in shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost position. The correct pattern involves moving all non-zero elements within each row as far as possible to the right while preserving their order, but starting from the end of the row and filling backwards. 

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid:
- Identify the non-zero elements.
- Start placing them from the rightmost end of the row, maintaining their order.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's correctly apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

Response: <reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses, the consistent pattern observed in the examples is that non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost position in each row, but crucially, the number of zeroes at the start of the output row matches the number of zeroes at the start of the input row. The reasoning in the previous attempts overlooked this precise handling of zeroes at the start of each row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid:
1. Identify the leading zeroes and count them.
2. Shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost position within the row, preserving their order.
3. Ensure the number of leading zeroes in the output row is the same as in the input row.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` 
   - Leading zeroes: 3
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 5
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 0
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0]`

4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 0
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0]`

   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`

   - Leading zeroes: 1
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8, 6]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`

9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 3
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[5, 5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`

10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Leading zeroes: 5
    - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8]`
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The corrected pattern ensures the leading zeroes are preserved as in the input, and non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost positions accordingly.

Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the examples more closely.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input and Output:**
     - The non-zero elements (2, 5, 3, 6, 8) appear to be moved to the right in their respective rows.
     - Observing closely, the non-zero elements maintain their order but are shifted to the rightmost available positions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input and Output:**
     - Similar pattern is observed where non-zero elements (3, 2, 8, 6) in each row are shifted to the right, retaining their order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input and Output:**
     - Again, non-zero elements (2, 6, 3, 8) are moved toward the rightmost side in their rows, maintaining their sequence.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent transformation pattern across all examples is that non-zero numbers are moved to the rightmost available position in each row without altering the order of these numbers within the row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost position within that row, preserving their sequence.

### Re-evaluation of the Previous Responses:
In both previous responses, the transformation seemed correct in terms of shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost position within each row. However, the error might have occurred in how the final positions of non-zero elements were calculated or displayed in the additional test input.

### Application to the Additional Test Input:
Let's apply this correctly to the additional input grid:

1. **Row 0:** `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2]`
2. **Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. **Row 2:** `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. **Row 3:** `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. **Row 4:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. **Row 5:** `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. **Row 6:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. **Row 7:** `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. **Row 8:** `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. **Row 9:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` should become `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

In all these transformations, the non-zero numbers are shifted correctly to the rightmost side of each row, maintaining their sequence.

Response: 
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's closely examine the examples once more and identify any errors or misinterpretations in the previous responses.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is moved to the rightmost possible position in its respective row, while maintaining their order. The transformation involves wrapping them around the grid's dimensions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position, maintaining the row and order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Again, shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row. The transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order. The key is to ensure that non-zero elements occupy the rightmost positions in the row, filling from right to left, and leaving the left part of the row with zeros.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`
2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`
3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The previous responses incorrectly determined the position of the shifted elements, leading to incorrect outputs. The key correction here is ensuring that non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost end while maintaining their relative order.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's closely examine the examples once more and identify any errors or misinterpretations in the previous responses.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is moved to the rightmost possible position in its respective row, while maintaining their order. The transformation involves wrapping them around the grid's dimensions.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position, maintaining the row and order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Again, shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern across all examples is that each colored shape is moved to the rightmost position in its respective row. The transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero (colored) cells and shift them to the rightmost possible position within that row, while preserving their original order. The key is to ensure that non-zero elements occupy the rightmost positions in the row, filling from right to left, and leaving the left part of the row with zeros.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule correctly to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3]`
4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4]`
5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`
6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`
8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`
9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`
10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Shift to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The previous responses incorrectly determined the position of the shifted elements, leading to incorrect outputs. The key correction here is ensuring that non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost end while maintaining their relative order.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Upon reviewing the previous responses, the consistent pattern observed in the examples is that non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost position in each row, but crucially, the number of zeroes at the start of the output row matches the number of zeroes at the start of the input row. The reasoning in the previous attempts overlooked this precise handling of zeroes at the start of each row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid:
1. Identify the leading zeroes and count them.
2. Shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost position within the row, preserving their order.
3. Ensure the number of leading zeroes in the output row is the same as in the input row.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` 
   - Leading zeroes: 3
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 5
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 0
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0]`

4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 0
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[2, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0]`

5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 4
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[4, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`

6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 3
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`

   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[6]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`

8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeroes: 1
   - Shifted non-zero elements: `[8, 6]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`

9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Response: <reasoning>
In the previous attempts, the primary issue was misinterpreting the transformation rule. Let's re-examine the examples to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is moved to the rightmost possible position in its respective row, while maintaining their order. The key observation here is that the number of trailing zeros after the last non-zero element in each row is preserved.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position, maintaining the row and order. Again, the number of trailing zeros after the last non-zero element is preserved.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order and the number of trailing zeros.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
In each row of the input grid:
1. Identify non-zero elements.
2. Shift these non-zero elements to the rightmost position within that row.
3. Ensure the number of trailing zeros (zeros after the last non-zero element of the original row) is preserved in the output.

### Application to Additional Input:
Apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[8, 2]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 4
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 2]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 3
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 5
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`

4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 4, 4]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 3
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0]`

5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[4, 4, 4]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 3
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]`

6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[8]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 6
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[6]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 4
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`

8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[8, 6]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 4
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 0]`

9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Non-zero elements: `[5, 5]`
   - Trailing zeros count: 5
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0]`

10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Non-zero elements: `[8]`
    - Trailing zeros count: 5
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The previous responses mispositioned the trailing zeros. This corrected approach ensures the trailing zeros are preserved as they were originally, and non-zero elements are right-aligned within the constraints of maintaining trailing zeros.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's reassess the transformation rule by analyzing the examples provided. The goal is to find a consistent pattern that applies to all examples and then apply it to the additional test input.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) at various positions.
   - **Output:** Each colored shape is moved to the rightmost possible position within its row, while maintaining their order and respecting the original leading zeros. 

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their rows, with the number of leading zeros preserved.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains colored shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are similarly shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving the number of leading zeros.

### Consistent Pattern:
For each row in the input grid:
- Identify the non-zero (colored) elements.
- Count the leading zeros.
- Shift the non-zero elements to the rightmost possible position within the row, while preserving their order.
- Ensure that the number of leading zeros in the output row matches the number in the input row.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
1. For each row in the input grid, count the number of leading zeros.
2. Identify and collect the non-zero elements.
3. Place the collected non-zero elements at the rightmost positions of the row, while keeping the original count of leading zeros intact.

Response: <reasoning>
The transformation rule observed from the examples involves shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost possible positions in each row while maintaining their order, and ensuring that the number of leading zeroes is preserved from the input to the output.

### Breakdown of the Rule:
1. **Identify Leading Zeroes:**
   - Count the number of leading zeroes in the input row.

2. **Shift Non-Zero Elements:**
   - Shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost positions in the output row, preserving their order.

3. **Preserve Leading Zeroes:**
   - Ensure that the number of leading zeroes in the output row is the same as in the input row.

### Analysis of Previous Incorrect Attempts:
- In both previous responses, there was a misunderstanding in shifting non-zero elements to the rightmost positions while maintaining the correct number of leading zeroes.
- The corrected understanding ensures that the zeroes at the beginning of the row remain unchanged, and the non-zero elements fill the available space to the right.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's reanalyze the transformation rule by examining the pattern in the given examples:

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Various colored shapes (2, 3, 5, 6, 8) scattered throughout the grid.
   - **Output:** Each shape is shifted to the rightmost possible position in its respective row.

2. **Example 2:**

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes (2, 3, 6, 8).
   - **Output:** Shapes are shifted to the rightmost position in their respective rows, preserving order.

### Consistent Pattern:
The consistent pattern is that non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost positions in each row, while maintaining their order. Importantly, the number of leading zeroes (initial zeroes) is preserved in the output, and the non-zero elements fill the remaining rightmost positions.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
1. For each row in the input grid:
   - Identify the leading zeroes and count them.
   - Shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost position within the row, preserving their order.
   - Ensure the number of leading zeroes in the output row is the same as in the input row.

   - **Input Row 1:** `[0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0]`
   - **Output Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2]`
   - Transformation: The non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost position within the row, preserving their order and maintaining the number of leading zeros.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input Row 1:** `[6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
   - **Output Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2]`
   - Transformation: The non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost position within the row, maintaining their order and the number of leading zeros.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
For each row in the input grid:
1. Count the number of leading zeros.
2. Identify the non-zero elements in the row.
3. Shift the non-zero elements to the rightmost position, preserving their order.
4. Ensure the number of leading zeros in the output row matches the input row.

### Application to Additional Input:
Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

1. Row 0: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 3
   - Non-zero elements: `[8, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 0]`

2. Row 1: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 5
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 2]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]`

3. Row 2: `[2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 0
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0]`

4. Row 3: `[2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 0
   - Non-zero elements: `[2, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0]`

5. Row 4: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 4
   - Non-zero elements: `[4, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4]`

6. Row 5: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 3
   - Non-zero elements: `[8]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

7. Row 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 6
   - Non-zero elements: `[6]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`

8. Row 7: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 1
   - Non-zero elements: `[8, 6]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6]`

9. Row 8: `[0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Leading zeros: 3
   - Non-zero elements: `[5, 5]`
   - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]`

10. Row 9: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    - Leading zeros: 5
    - Non-zero elements: `[8]`
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`

The key is to ensure that the number of leading zeros in the output matches the input, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the rightmost positions. This corrects the oversight in previous responses.

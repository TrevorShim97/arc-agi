========== SYSTEM PROMPT ==========

You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids." A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers (list[list[int]] in python code). Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output. You must resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule before returning the predicted output grid. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. As another example, if some shape(s) or cells in the input are relocated or recolored, you need to determine which exact shapes should be relocated/recolored in the output and where they should be moved or what their color in the output should be. Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before returning the predicted output grid. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step-by-step reasoning.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1-cell holes are filled with pink, 2-cell holes are filled with blue, and 3-cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before returning the predicted output grid.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, return the predicted output grid enclosed in <output></output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. DO NOT include any other text or code within the <output> tags except for the output grid.

You might also be provided with an incorrect output grid that you've returned for these examples during a previous attempt. If you are provided with an incorrect previous answer, you should carefully read through its reasoning to figure out what went wrong and return a corrected output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the example inputs and outputs.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- The input contains a small pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) in the top section and a row of 1s in the middle.
- The output has the same row of 1s in the middle, but the top section's pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) has been transformed:
  - 2s are turned to 3s and 3s are turned to 2s.
- Additionally, the pattern from the top section in the input is mirrored to the bottom section of the output with the transformation applied.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s on the right side and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- The output maintains the vertical line of 1s and mirrors the pattern of 8s and 4s horizontally to the left side.
  - 8s are turned to 4s and 4s are turned to 8s.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- The input contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom.
- The output maintains the horizontal line of 1s and mirrors the pattern of 5s and 6s vertically above.
  - 5s are turned to 6s and 6s are turned to 5s.

From these examples, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input.
2. Transform the pattern by swapping numbers (2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6).
3. Mirror the transformed pattern to the opposite side of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The test input contains a vertical line of 1s in the middle and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Transform 8s to 4s and 2s to 3s.
  - Mirror this transformed pattern horizontally to the opposite side.

Let's construct the output based on this analysis.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the paired examples step-by-step:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input has a grid with two distinct areas of non-zero numbers: a pattern in the top left and a horizontal line of '1's in the middle.
   - The output changes the '2's to '3's and '3's to '2's in the first pattern. After this transformation, this pattern is mirrored vertically to the bottom of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input has a vertical line of '1's and a pattern of '8's and '4's.
   - The '8's and '4's are transformed in a way that seems to reflect or rotate parts of the pattern within a local area. Specifically, the '8' and '4' patterns are rotated or reflected around the area they occupy, while the vertical line of '1's remains unchanged.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input shows a horizontal line of '1's and a pattern of '5's and '6's at the bottom of the grid.
   - The transformation involves flipping the '5' and '6' pattern to the top of the grid, maintaining the horizontal structure. The line of '1's remains unchanged.

From these examples, we observe:
- A pattern of transformation where specific areas or shapes within the grid are either reflected, rotated or mirrored.
- The vertical or horizontal lines of '1's remain unchanged.
- The transformation involves flipping the pattern to the opposite side of the grid.
- The colors within the pattern are also transformed in a predictable manner (e.g., '2' to '3', '3' to '2').

**General Rule:**
1. Identify distinct regions or patterns in the grid.
2. Transform colors within the pattern according to a specific transformation (e.g., '2' to '3', '3' to '2', etc.).
3. Mirror or flip the pattern to the opposite side of the grid while retaining any invariant features like lines of '1's.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

- The input has a vertical line of '1's and a pattern of '2's and '8's with a specific arrangement.
- We need to transform the pattern's colors and flip it to the opposite side of the grid.

Applying this rule:
- The '2's in the top pattern should become '3's.
- The '8's should either transform or maintain their positions depending on the observed transformation pattern.
- The entire pattern should be flipped to the bottom of the grid.
- The vertical line of '1's should remain unchanged.

Let's implement this rule in code.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples step by step:

### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

In this example, the grid is mirrored vertically along the center row (5th row).

### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
   [0, 0, 4, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 8, 0],
   [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

Again, the grid is split around the 5th row and mirrored vertically.

### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 5, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 6, 5, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
  ```

Again, this grid is mirrored vertically around the center row (7th row).

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule is to mirror the grid vertically around the center row. This involves flipping the upper half of the grid to the lower half and vice versa. The line of symmetry is the center row of the grid.

### Additional Test Input:
The grid is 14 rows in height, so the center row is the 7th row. We'll mirror the grid vertically around this row.
</reasoning>

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

```python
def mirror_vertical(input_grid):
    rows = len(input_grid)
    mid = rows // 2
    output_grid = input_grid[:]
    for i in range(mid):
        output_grid[i], output_grid[rows - i - 1] = input_grid[rows - i - 1], input_grid[i]
    return output_grid

additional_input = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

predicted_output = mirror_vertical(additional_input)

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid has a line of blue (1) at row 4, and a pattern of red (2) and green (3) colors in the top half.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged, the red pattern is mirrored vertically (top to bottom), and the green pattern is also mirrored vertically.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of blue (1) down the center-right, and a pattern of purple (8) and yellow (4) in the lower right quadrant.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged. The purple and yellow patterns are mirrored vertically across the line of blue.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** The grid has a line of blue (1) at row 8, and a pattern of pink (6) and grey (5) in the lower right quadrant.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged. The pink and grey patterns are mirrored vertically.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify the horizontal or vertical line of blue (1) cells in the input grid.
2. Mirror any colored pattern (other than blue) vertically around the blue line.

**Additional Input Analysis:**
- The additional input has a vertical line of blue (1) on the ninth column.
- There is a pattern of red (2) and purple (8) in the upper central part of the grid.

Using the identified rule, we should:
1. Keep the blue vertical line unchanged.
2. Vertically mirror the red and purple pattern around the blue line.

Let's apply this transformation to the additional input grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- Input has two distinct sections with colored patterns: 
  - Top pattern with colors: [2, 3, 2] and [2, 3, 3] and a single [2].
  - Bottom pattern, which is a mirrored version of the top pattern.
- The output mirrors the top pattern to the bottom and replaces the color 2 with 3 in the mirrored pattern.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- Input has two distinct sections with colored patterns:
  - Right pattern with colors: [8, 4, 8] and [0, 8, 8].
  - The output mirrors the right pattern to the left and replaces the color 8 with 4 and 4 with 8 in the mirrored pattern.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- Input has two distinct sections with colored patterns:
  - Bottom pattern with colors: [5, 6, 6, 5] and [6, 6, 6, 6].
  - The output mirrors the bottom pattern to the top and replaces the color 6 with 5 and 5 with 6 in the mirrored pattern.

**Identified Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify the colored pattern in the input.
2. Mirror the pattern vertically (from top to bottom or vice versa).
3. Swap colors in the mirrored pattern: 
   - If colors are 2 and 3 in the original, swap 2 with 3.
   - If colors are 8 and 4 in the original, swap 8 with 4.
   - If colors are 5 and 6 in the original, swap 5 with 6.

Now applying this rule to the additional test input:

- Identify the top pattern: It has colors [2, 8, 2] and [8, 8, 8].
- Mirror this pattern to the bottom.
- Swap colors: 2 becomes 8 and 8 becomes 2 in the mirrored pattern.

Let's implement this transformation rule on the additional input grid.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the example inputs and outputs.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- The input contains a small pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) in the top section and a row of 1s in the middle.
- The output has the same row of 1s in the middle, but the top section's pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) has been transformed:
  - 2s are turned to 3s and 3s are turned to 2s.
- Additionally, the pattern from the top section in the input is mirrored to the bottom section of the output with the transformation applied.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s on the right side and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- The output maintains the vertical line of 1s and mirrors the pattern of 8s and 4s horizontally to the left side.
  - 8s are turned to 4s and 4s are turned to 8s.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- The input contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom.
- The output maintains the horizontal line of 1s and mirrors the pattern of 5s and 6s vertically above.
  - 5s are turned to 6s and 6s are turned to 5s.

From these examples, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input.
2. Transform the pattern by swapping numbers (2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6).
3. Mirror the transformed pattern to the opposite side of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The test input contains a vertical line of 1s in the middle and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Transform 8s to 4s and 2s to 3s.
  - Mirror this transformed pattern horizontally to the opposite side.

Let's construct the output based on this analysis.

Response 2

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples step by step:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid has a line of blue (1) at row 4, and a pattern of red (2) and green (3) colors in the top half.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged, the red pattern is mirrored vertically (top to bottom), and the green pattern is also mirrored vertically.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of blue (1) down the center-right, and a pattern of purple (8) and yellow (4) in the lower right quadrant.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged. The purple and yellow patterns are mirrored vertically across the line of blue.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** The grid has a line of blue (1) at row 8, and a pattern of pink (6) and grey (5) in the lower right quadrant.
- **Output:** The blue line remains unchanged. The pink and grey patterns are mirrored vertically.

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify the horizontal or vertical line of blue (1) cells in the input grid.
2. Mirror any colored pattern (other than blue) vertically around the blue line.

**Additional Input Analysis:**
- The additional input has a vertical line of blue (1) on the ninth column.
- There is a pattern of red (2) and purple (8) in the upper central part of the grid.

Using the identified rule, we should:
1. Keep the blue vertical line unchanged.
2. Vertically mirror the red and purple pattern around the blue line.

Let's apply this transformation to the additional input grid.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's review the transformation rule by analyzing the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- The input contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top half and a row of 1s in the fifth row.
- The output mirrors the pattern of 2s and 3s from the top to the bottom, and swaps 2s with 3s and vice versa.
- The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- The input has a vertical line of 1s on the seventh column and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- The output mirrors the pattern of 8s and 4s horizontally to the left and swaps 8s with 4s and vice versa.
- The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- The input has a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom and a row of 1s at the ninth row.
- The output mirrors the pattern of 5s and 6s vertically upwards and swaps 5s with 6s and vice versa.
- The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify the line of 1s (either horizontal or vertical) in the input.
2. Identify the pattern of numbers (other than 1) in the input.
3. Mirror the pattern around the line of 1s and swap the numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6

**Additional Input Analysis:**
- The additional input has a vertical line of 1s on the ninth column and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 8s to 4s and 2s to 3s.
  - Mirror this transformed pattern horizontally to the opposite side.

The two previous responses failed to correctly apply the mirroring and swapping transformation. The first response mirrored the pattern without swapping colors. The second response maintained the pattern without transforming it. 

Let's apply the correct transformation to the additional input.

To determine the correct transformation rule, let's re-evaluate the given examples and the previous responses carefully.

**Example 1:**
- The input has a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top portion.
- The output transforms 2s to 3s and 3s to 2s, while mirroring this pattern to the bottom half of the grid.

**Example 2:**
- The input has a vertical line of 1s with a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- The output mirrors the pattern of 8s and 4s horizontally, swapping 8s with 4s and vice-versa.

**Example 3:**
- The input has a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- The output mirrors this pattern vertically, swapping 5s with 6s and 6s with 5s.

The common transformation rule across these examples is:
1. Identify distinct color patterns in the grid.
2. Swap specific numbers in these patterns (e.g., 2 with 3, 4 with 8, 5 with 6) and mirror them across a line of symmetry (either vertical or horizontal).

Both previous responses failed to correctly apply this pattern transformation rule to the additional test input.

**Additional Test Input Analysis:**
- The test input includes a vertical line of 1s and patterns of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror these swapped patterns across the vertical line of 1s.

Let's apply this transformation rule:
1. Identify the pattern to transform (2s and 8s).
2. Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
3. Mirror the swapped pattern horizontally around the vertical line of 1s.

Now let's construct the output grid based on this corrected understanding.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's analyze the given examples to determine the transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid. There is a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The row of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, and the numbers are swapped (2 <-> 3).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4).

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom with a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards with numbers swapped (5 <-> 6).

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to involve:
1. Identifying a line of 1s that acts as a mirror axis.
2. Mirroring the pattern of numbers across this axis.
3. Swapping specific pairs of numbers during the mirroring process.

The specific swaps observed are:
- 2 <-> 3
- 4 <-> 8
- 5 <-> 6

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the 9th column and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- Following the rule:
  - Mirror the pattern of 8s and 2s horizontally across the line of 1s.
  - Swap the numbers during mirroring: 8 <-> 4 and 2 <-> 3.

Thus, we need to swap the 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s and mirror them horizontally around the vertical 1s.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples again to identify the correct transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- Input: Contains a pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) near the top, and a row of 1s in the middle.
- Output: The pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) is mirrored vertically, with the 2s and 3s swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- Input: Contains a vertical line of 1s on the right side and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- Output: The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored vertically with the 8s and 4s swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- Input: Contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- Output: The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically with the 5s and 6s swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically to the opposite side of the grid.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s on the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern vertically.

Let's construct the output based on this analysis.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the pattern in the examples more carefully.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- The input has a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top half and a line of 1s in the 5th row.
- The output changes the 2s to 3s and 3s to 2s and mirrors this pattern, moving it to the bottom half symmetrically around the line of 1s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- The input has a vertical line of 1s in the 7th column and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- The output mirrors the 8s and 4s pattern around the vertical line of 1s, swapping 8s with 4s and 4s with 8s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- The input has a horizontal line of 1s in the 9th row and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- The output mirrors the pattern of 5s and 6s, swapping 5s with 6s and 6s with 5s and reflecting it to the top half symmetrically around the line of 1s at the 9th row. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. Identify the line of 1s, which divides the grid into two regions.
2. Transform any non-1 pattern by swapping specific pairs of numbers (2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6).
3. Mirror the transformed pattern across the line of 1s.

**Additional Input Analysis:**
- The input has a vertical line of 1s in the 9th column.
- There is a pattern of 2s and 8s in the central part of the grid.
- According to the rule, we need to transform 2s to 3s and 8s to 4s, and mirror this pattern around the vertical line of 1s.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the additional input to produce the correct output grid.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples again to identify the correct transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- Input: Contains a pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) near the top, and a row of 1s in the middle.
- Output: The pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) is mirrored vertically, with the 2s and 3s swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- Input: Contains a vertical line of 1s on the right side and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- Output: The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored vertically with the 8s and 4s swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- Input: Contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- Output: The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically with the 5s and 6s swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically to the opposite side of the grid.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s on the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern vertically.

Let's construct the output based on this analysis.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Let's analyze the given examples to determine the transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid. There is a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The row of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, and the numbers are swapped (2 <-> 3).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4).

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom with a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards with numbers swapped (5 <-> 6).

From these examples, the transformation rule appears to involve:
1. Identifying a line of 1s that acts as a mirror axis.
2. Mirroring the pattern of numbers across this axis.
3. Swapping specific pairs of numbers during the mirroring process.

The specific swaps observed are:
- 2 <-> 3
- 4 <-> 8
- 5 <-> 6

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the 9th column and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- Following the rule:
  - Mirror the pattern of 8s and 2s horizontally across the line of 1s.
  - Swap the numbers during mirroring: 8 <-> 4 and 2 <-> 3.

Thus, we need to swap the 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s and mirror them horizontally around the vertical 1s.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples again to identify the correct transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 2s and 3s near the top of the grid, and a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom part of the grid with the numbers swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of 1s on the seventh column and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom of the grid with a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards with numbers swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.
3. Mirror the transformed pattern across the line of 1s.
4. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

The mirroring direction (horizontal or vertical) depends on the orientation of the line of 1s.

Let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

**Test Input:**
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s on the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Let's construct the output based on this analysis.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples once more to determine the correct transformation rule and understand where the previous responses may have gone wrong.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of 2s and 3s at the top, and a row of 1s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s at the top is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, with 2s and 3s swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s stays unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Contains a vertical line of 1s on the right side and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally on the left side with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of 5s and 6s at the bottom with a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically to the top with numbers swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation involves:
1. Identifying a line of 1s that acts as a mirror axis.
2. Mirroring the pattern of numbers across this axis.
3. Swapping specific pairs of numbers during the mirroring process.

The specific swaps observed are:
- 2 <-> 3
- 4 <-> 8
- 5 <-> 6

For the additional test input, it contains a vertical line of 1s at the 9th column and a pattern of 2s and 8s. Following the rule:
- Mirror the pattern of 2s and 8s horizontally across the line of 1s.
- Swap the numbers during mirroring: 8 <-> 4 and 2 <-> 3.

Let's apply this rule correctly to generate the output.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's evaluate the transformation rule by examining the given examples closely.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid, and a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The row of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, and the numbers are swapped (2 <-> 3).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4).

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** There is a pattern of 5s and 6s near the bottom with a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged. The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards with numbers swapped (5 <-> 6).

**General Observations:**
- The grid seems to have a line of 1s that acts as a mirror axis.
- Patterns (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 8s) are mirrored across this axis.
- Specific numbers are swapped during the mirroring: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.

**Problems Identified in Previous Attempts:**
- In the first response, the output grid did not correctly apply the mirroring and swapping transformation.
- In the second response, the mirroring was applied incorrectly; it should be around the entire grid, not just around the 1s.

**Test Input:**
- The test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the 9th column and a pattern of 8s and 2s.
- Following the rule:
  - Swap 8s with 4s and 2s with 3s.
  - Mirror the pattern across the entire grid's vertical centerline, which is the 8th column.

Let's apply these transformations to generate the correct output for the additional test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's re-evaluate the examples to discern the correct transformation rule accurately.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid and a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, with the numbers swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Contains a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored vertically to the opposite side of the grid, with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** Contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically to the top half, with the numbers swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify a pattern of numbers (excluding 1s) in the grid.
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically with respect to the axis defined by the line of 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

Both previous responses identified the transformation rule correctly but made errors in the application.

For the additional test input:
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's address the errors in the previous responses by re-evaluating the transformation rule with the examples provided.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A pattern of 2s and 3s is present in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s is present, along with a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally around the line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, and the numbers 5 and 6 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Given the vertical line of 1s, the mirroring should be horizontal around this line. Let's apply the transformation to the test input accordingly.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's address the errors in the previous responses by re-evaluating the transformation rule with the examples provided.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A pattern of 2s and 3s is present in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s is present, along with a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally around the line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, and the numbers 5 and 6 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Given the vertical line of 1s, the mirroring should be horizontal around this line. Let's apply the transformation to the test input accordingly.

</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
Let's re-evaluate the examples to discern the correct transformation rule accurately.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid and a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, with the numbers swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Contains a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored vertically to the opposite side of the grid, with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** Contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically to the top half, with the numbers swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify a pattern of numbers (excluding 1s) in the grid.
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 8, 5 <-> 6.
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically with respect to the axis defined by the line of 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

Both previous responses identified the transformation rule correctly but made errors in the application.

For the additional test input:
- The input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Let's construct the correct output based on this analysis.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the given examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the fifth row.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically and shifted to the bottom half of the grid, with the numbers 2 and 3 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s exists in the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s on the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, with the numbers 8 and 4 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s exists at the ninth row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically, based on the orientation of the 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Upon reviewing the previous responses, the mistake was in misunderstanding the mirroring process. The mirroring should occur horizontally across the line of 1s in the ninth column. Let's apply the transformation to the test input accordingly.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples and deduce the correct transformation rule.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- **Input:** The grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically. The numbers 2 and 3 are swapped, and the line of 1s remains unchanged. Additionally, the original pattern of 2s and 3s is moved to a lower position.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- **Input:** The grid contains a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is rearranged such that the pattern is mirrored horizontally around the line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged, and some rows appear to have been shifted vertically.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- **Input:** The grid has a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Summary of Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify a pattern of colors in the input, excluding the line of 1s.
2. Swap specific numbers within the pattern:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically or horizontally based on the position of the line of 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern vertically along the grid.
  - Ensure the line of 1s remains unchanged.

Now, let's apply the transformation to the test input to construct the correct output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully examine the transformation rule using the provided examples. The key is to identify consistent patterns across the examples and apply them to the test input.

**Example 1 Analysis:**
- **Input Pattern:** The input grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle row.
- **Output Pattern:** In the output, the pattern of 2s and 3s has been mirrored vertically to the bottom part of the grid, with the numbers 2 and 3 swapped. The middle row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2 Analysis:**
- **Input Pattern:** The input grid includes a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output Pattern:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally around the vertical line of 1s, with the numbers 8 and 4 swapped. The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3 Analysis:**
- **Input Pattern:** The input has a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom, and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output Pattern:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify the non-zero pattern, excluding the 1s.
2. Swap specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern across the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input has a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the vertical line of 1s.

Let's apply this transformation rule to the test input:

1. Swap colors: 2s become 3s, and 8s become 4s.
2. Mirror the resulting pattern across the vertical line of 1s located at the ninth column.

The previous responses did not correctly apply the horizontal mirroring around the vertical line of 1s. Let's correct this.

Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's closely analyze the provided examples again.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** A pattern of 2s and 3s is found in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle row.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s along the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally around the vertical line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s at the bottom, with a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, and the numbers 5 and 6 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be discerned as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

The error in the previous responses was likely due to the incorrect handling or placement of the mirrored pattern. Let's construct the output based on this corrected understanding.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully re-evaluate the examples to discern the correct transformation rule accurately.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top part of the grid and a row of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, with the numbers swapped (2 <-> 3). The row of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Contains a vertical line of 1s and a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored vertically to the opposite side of the grid, with numbers swapped (8 <-> 4). The vertical line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** Contains a horizontal line of 1s at the bottom and a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically to the top half, with the numbers swapped (5 <-> 6). The horizontal line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as:
1. Identify a pattern of numbers (excluding 1s) in the grid.
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern vertically with respect to the axis defined by the line of 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

For the test input, it contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s:
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

The previous responses identified the transformation rule correctly but made errors in the application by incorrectly mirroring or swapping colors. The correct approach is to swap the colors first and then mirror the pattern around the 1s line. Let's construct the correct output based on this analysis.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the given examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid contains a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the fifth row.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically and shifted to the bottom half of the grid, with the numbers 2 and 3 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s exists in the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s on the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, with the numbers 8 and 4 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s exists at the ninth row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers: 
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically, based on the orientation of the 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Upon reviewing the previous responses, the mistake was in misunderstanding the mirroring process. The mirroring should occur horizontally across the line of 1s in the ninth column. Let's apply the transformation to the test input accordingly.

Response 2

<reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's closely analyze the provided examples again.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** A pattern of 2s and 3s is found in the top rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the middle row.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s along the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally around the vertical line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s at the bottom, with a pattern of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, and the numbers 5 and 6 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be discerned as follows:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

The error in the previous responses was likely due to the incorrect handling or placement of the mirrored pattern. Let's construct the output based on this corrected understanding.

</output>


Response: <reasoning>
Let's start by re-analyzing the examples to identify the correct transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** We have patterns of 2s and 3s in the top rows. A horizontal line of 1s exists in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored and shifted to the bottom half of the grid, swapping 2s with 3s and vice versa. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s in the seventh column, with patterns of 8s and 4s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, swapping 8s with 4s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s at the ninth row, with patterns of 5s and 6s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, swapping 5s with 6s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Identified Transformation Rule:**
1. Identify the non-zero pattern, excluding the line of 1s.
2. Swap specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern across the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column with patterns of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the vertical line of 1s.

The previous responses incorrectly handled the mirroring process. The mirroring should occur horizontally across the line of 1s at the ninth column, meaning the left side should be mirrored to the right side maintaining symmetry and ensuring the swap rule is applied.

Let's apply this understanding to construct the correct output for the test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the given examples:

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid has a pattern of numbers (2s and 3s) in the top rows and a horizontal line of 1s in the fifth row.
- **Output:** The pattern of numbers is mirrored vertically, moving to the bottom half of the grid, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** The grid has a vertical line of 1s in the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s on the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, and the numbers 8 and 4 are swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** The grid has a horizontal line of 1s at the ninth row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, we can deduce the transformation rule:
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically, based on the orientation of the 1s.
4. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Analysis for Test Input:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and patterns of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

The errors in the previous responses were due to incorrect placement or handling of the mirrored pattern. Let's apply the transformation correctly to the test input.

To correctly apply the mirroring operation, we should ensure that the pattern is mirrored around the vertical line of 1s (which is in the ninth column). The transformed pattern should be on the opposite side of the 1s column.

Let's construct the output based on this corrected understanding.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's re-examine the examples and the responses to identify the correct transformation rule and the issue in the previous attempts.

### Example Analysis

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The pattern of interest involves the numbers 2 and 3 in the top three rows, with a horizontal line of 1s in the fifth row.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically and shifted to the bottom half of the grid, with the numbers 2 and 3 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s in the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s to the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, with the numbers 8 and 4 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s in the ninth row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

### Transformation Rule
1. Identify the non-zero pattern in the input grid (excluding the 1s).
2. Transform the pattern by swapping specific numbers:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically, depending on the orientation of the 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

### Test Input Analysis
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s in the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- **Required Transformation:**
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

### Previous Response Issues
Both previous responses incorrectly mirrored the pattern horizontally using incorrect placement. The mirroring should be done such that the left part of the pattern (before the line of 1s) should be correctly mirrored to the right side of the line and vice versa, considering the swap of colors.

Let's correctly apply the transformation to the test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's closely analyze the examples to determine the transformation rule.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** The grid has a pattern of 2s and 3s in the top rows. There's a horizontal line of 1s in the middle.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom half, and 2s are swapped with 3s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** A vertical line of 1s at the seventh column is present, with a pattern of 8s and 4s on the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, with 8s swapped with 4s. The line of 1s is unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s is found at the ninth row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, and 5s are swapped with 6s. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, we can deduce the transformation rule:
1. Identify the pattern in the input grid, excluding the 1s.
2. Swap specific numbers in the pattern:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern around the line of 1s, either horizontally or vertically, depending on the orientation of the 1s.
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input has a vertical line of 1s at the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally around the line of 1s.

The previous responses likely misapplied the mirroring or swapping process. Let's correctly apply the transformation to the test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's analyze the transformation rule based on the given examples again, keeping in mind the mistakes in the previous responses.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** A pattern with 2s and 3s is present in the top rows, separated by a horizontal line of 1s.
- **Output:** The pattern of 2s and 3s is mirrored vertically to the bottom, and the numbers 2 and 3 are swapped. The line of 1s remains as is.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Features a vertical line of 1s in the seventh column, with a pattern of 8s and 4s to the right.
- **Output:** The pattern of 8s and 4s is mirrored horizontally across the line of 1s, with the numbers 8 and 4 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** A horizontal line of 1s is present in the bottom row, with a pattern of 5s and 6s below it.
- **Output:** The pattern of 5s and 6s is mirrored vertically upwards, with the numbers 5 and 6 swapped. The line of 1s remains unchanged.

From these examples, the transformation rule can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Identify all non-zero patterns in the input grid, excluding the lines of 1s.
2. Swap the following numbers in these patterns:
   - 2 <-> 3
   - 4 <-> 8
   - 5 <-> 6
3. Mirror the transformed pattern across the line of 1s, either horizontally if the line is vertical (like a column) or vertically if the line is horizontal (like a row).
4. Maintain the line of 1s unchanged.

**Test Input Analysis:**
- The additional test input contains a vertical line of 1s in the ninth column and a pattern of 2s and 8s to the left.
- According to the transformation rule:
  - Swap 2s with 3s and 8s with 4s.
  - Mirror the transformed pattern horizontally across the line of 1s.

Both previous responses failed to correctly apply the mirroring and swapping. The mirroring should occur horizontally across the line of 1s in the ninth column. A corrected application of this transformation rule should be done on the provided test input.

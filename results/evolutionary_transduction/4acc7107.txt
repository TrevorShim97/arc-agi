========== SYSTEM PROMPT ==========

You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs). Your task is to determine the transformation rule and implement it in code.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids." A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers (list[list[int]] in python code). Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output. You must resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule before returning the predicted output grid. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. As another example, if some shape(s) or cells in the input are relocated or recolored, you need to determine which exact shapes should be relocated/recolored in the output and where they should be moved or what their color in the output should be. Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before returning the predicted output grid. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step-by-step reasoning.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1-cell holes are filled with pink, 2-cell holes are filled with blue, and 3-cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before returning the predicted output grid.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. Then, implement the transformation in code.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, return the predicted output grid enclosed in <output></output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. DO NOT include any other text or code within the <output> tags except for the output grid.

You might also be provided with an incorrect output grid that you've returned for these examples during a previous attempt. If you are provided with an incorrect previous answer, you should carefully read through its reasoning to figure out what went wrong and return a corrected output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples.

### Example 1 Analysis:
- **Input** has clusters of numbers 1, 6, and empty spaces (0).
- **Output** seems to rearrange these clusters: 
  - The cluster of 1s (initially at the top) is moved towards the bottom and right.
  - The cluster of 6s (initially at the bottom and left) is moved upwards and somewhat rightwards.

### Example 2 Analysis:
- **Input** has clusters of numbers 3, 4, and empty spaces (0).
- **Output** rearranges these clusters:
  - The cluster of 3s (initially at the top) is shifted downwards and partially rightwards.
  - The cluster of 4s (initially at the middle bottom) is moved upwards.

### Example 3 Analysis:
- **Input** has clusters of numbers 8, 4, and empty spaces (0).
- **Output** rearranges these clusters:
  - The cluster of 8s is shifted upwards.
  - The cluster of 4s is also shifted upwards.

### Example 4 Analysis:
- **Input** has clusters of numbers 7, 9, and empty spaces (0).
- **Output** rearranges these clusters:
  - The cluster of 7s is shifted upwards and to the left.
  - The cluster of 9s is moved upwards.

### Observations
1. In each example, clusters of numbers are shifted, often upwards.
2. The sequence in which the clusters appear doesn't change, but their positions are altered.
3. It appears that the transformation rule is to move clusters upwards into the first available open spaces, maintaining their order.
4. The rule seems to apply regardless of the specific character of the numbers, focusing instead on shifting upwards.

### Applying the Rule
For the additional test input, the grid contains clusters of numbers 2 and 3. Applying the rule, we should move these upwards:

- Cluster of 2s at the top (row 1) should be moved as far up as possible.
- Cluster of 3s at the bottom should also be moved upwards.

Following the pattern observed in the examples, we should move each cluster upwards into the first available space.

### Conclusion
The transformation involves moving the clusters of numbers upwards as much as possible, preserving their internal structure and the sequence in which they originally appeared.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - **Input**: There are two distinct colored patterns, one of blue (1) and another of pink (6).
   - **Output**: The blue pattern is moved downwards, and the pink pattern is moved upwards.
   - **Observation**: The blue pattern moves down by 3 rows, and the pink pattern moves up by 4 rows. This is consistent with the number of zero rows between the patterns in the input.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: There are patterns of green (3) and yellow (4).
   - **Output**: Green is moved down, and yellow is moved up.
   - **Observation**: The green pattern is moved down by 4 rows, and the yellow pattern is moved up by 4 rows.

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**: There are patterns of purple (8) and yellow (4).
   - **Output**: Purple is moved down, and yellow is moved up.
   - **Observation**: Purple moves down by 4 rows, and yellow moves up by 1 row.

4. **Example 4**:
   - **Input**: There are patterns of orange (7) and brown (9).
   - **Output**: Orange is moved down, and brown is moved up.
   - **Observation**: Orange moves down by 4 rows, and brown moves up by 1 row.

**General Rule**:
- It seems that the transformation involves moving each colored block either up or down such that the two colored blocks switch their vertical positions.
- A colored block is moved down if it is the topmost block in the input, and it moves up if it is the bottommost block.
- The movement is precisely the number of rows necessary to swap their positions.

**Apply the Rule to the Additional Test Input**:
- **Input**: Patterns of red (2) and green (3).
- Red is at the top and green is at the bottom.
- Red should move down, and green should move up.
- Red moves down by 4 rows (to the position of green), and green moves up by 2 rows (to the position of red).

Let's apply these observations to generate the output for the additional test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples and their outputs.

**Example 1:**
- The input contains three distinct non-zero colored regions: a vertical column of 6's, a horizontal line of 1's, and a small block of 1's.
- In the output, the vertical column of 6's and the horizontal line of 1's have been moved down and to the right, respectively.

**Example 2:**
- The input contains two main non-zero colored regions: a block of 3's and a block of 4's.
- In the output, the block of 3's has been shifted down and to the right, while the block of 4's remains in the same horizontal position but is shifted downward.

**Example 3:**
- The input contains two main non-zero colored regions: a vertical block of 8's and a horizontal block of 4's.
- In the output, the vertical block of 8's is shifted downwards, and the horizontal block of 4's is split and shifted vertically.

**Example 4:**
- The input contains two main non-zero colored regions: a block of 7's and a block of 9's.
- In the output, the block of 7's is shifted downwards, and the block of 9's is also shifted downwards.

From these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:
1. Identify distinct non-zero colored regions.
2. Shift these regions downward and potentially to the right, ensuring no overlap occurs.
3. Maintain the relative horizontal order of the regions.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input:

The additional test input contains:
- A block of 2's from (1,0) to (3,3).
- A block of 3's from (1,6) to (3,8).
- A second block of 3's from (5,3) to (7,3).
- A block of 2's from (6,6) to (7,8).

Applying the transformation rule:
- Shift the block of 2's downwards.
- Shift the two blocks of 3's downwards.
- Ensure no overlap occurs.
- Maintain the relative horizontal order.

We will now implement this rule to produce the output for the test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples step by step.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical blue line, a cross-shaped pink block, and some isolated black spaces.
   - Output: The blue line and black spaces are removed. The pink block is shifted downwards and leftwards.
   - Observation: The pink shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical green line and an L-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The vertical line is removed. The L-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains a horizontal purple line and a T-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The purple line is removed. The T-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical blue line and an L-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The blue line is removed. The L-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

**Common Rule Observed:**
- In each case, there is a specific colored shape (ignoring the isolated single lines or blocks of different colors) that is moved to the bottom-left corner of the grid.
- The transformation involves shifting all non-black shapes of a particular color to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Additional Observations:**
- The shape is always the one that is not in a single line or small isolated group.
- The shape is moved such that its bottom-most part aligns with the bottom row of the grid, and its left-most part aligns with the left column.

**Conclusion:**
The transformation rule is to identify the main shape (not isolated lines or blocks) and shift it to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

**Test Input:**
- Contains a horizontal green line and a T-shaped orange block.
- The T-shaped orange block should be shifted to the bottom-left corner.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify the main shape (orange T-shaped block).
2. Shift it to the bottom-left corner, ensuring its bottom-most part aligns with the bottom row and its left-most part aligns with the left column.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, we will analyze the examples step-by-step to identify any patterns or operations applied to the inputs to produce the outputs.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input contains blocks of numbers: 1s and 6s.
   - Output has shifted these blocks:
     - The block of 1s appears to be shifted downwards and to the right.
     - The block of 6s is also shifted downwards.
   - Observing the output: the block of 1s and 6s seems to be moved to the bottom right corner.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - Output shifts these blocks:
     - Block of 3s is moved downwards and partially to the right.
     - Block of 4s is moved downwards and partially to the right.
   - The blocks seem to be moved towards the bottom of the grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - Output shifts:
     - Block of 8s is moved downwards.
     - Block of 4s is moved slightly right and downwards.
   - Again, blocks are moved towards the bottom of the grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - Output shifts:
     - Block of 7s is moved downwards.
     - Block of 9s is moved to the right and downwards.
   - The movement is consistent with blocks being shifted towards the bottom right.

**General Transformation Rule:**
- The input grid contains blocks of colored numbers, which are moved closer to the bottom of the grid in the output.
- The blocks are shifted downwards and sometimes to the right. This movement maintains the integrity of the block (meaning the block shape is preserved).

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Apply the rule of shifting these blocks down and to the bottom right while maintaining their shape.

Let's implement this transformation for the given test input.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the examples step by step.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical blue line, a cross-shaped pink block, and some isolated black spaces.
   - Output: The blue line and black spaces are removed. The pink block is shifted downwards and leftwards.
   - Observation: The pink shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical green line and an L-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The vertical line is removed. The L-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains a horizontal purple line and a T-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The purple line is removed. The T-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains a vertical blue line and an L-shaped yellow block.
   - Output: The blue line is removed. The L-shaped block is shifted down and left.
   - Observation: The yellow shapes are shifted to the bottom-left corner.

**Common Rule Observed:**
- In each case, there is a specific colored shape (ignoring the isolated single lines or blocks of different colors) that is moved to the bottom-left corner of the grid.
- The transformation involves shifting all non-black shapes of a particular color to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Additional Observations:**
- The shape is always the one that is not in a single line or small isolated group.
- The shape is moved such that its bottom-most part aligns with the bottom row of the grid, and its left-most part aligns with the left column.

**Conclusion:**
The transformation rule is to identify the main shape (not isolated lines or blocks) and shift it to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

**Test Input:**
- Contains a horizontal green line and a T-shaped orange block.
- The T-shaped orange block should be shifted to the bottom-left corner.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify the main shape (orange T-shaped block).
2. Shift it to the bottom-left corner, ensuring its bottom-most part aligns with the bottom row and its left-most part aligns with the left column.

Response 2

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, we will analyze the examples step-by-step to identify any patterns or operations applied to the inputs to produce the outputs.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input contains blocks of numbers: 1s and 6s.
   - Output has shifted these blocks:
     - The block of 1s appears to be shifted downwards and to the right.
     - The block of 6s is also shifted downwards.
   - Observing the output: the block of 1s and 6s seems to be moved to the bottom right corner.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - Output shifts these blocks:
     - Block of 3s is moved downwards and partially to the right.
     - Block of 4s is moved downwards and partially to the right.
   - The blocks seem to be moved towards the bottom of the grid.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - Output shifts:
     - Block of 8s is moved downwards.
     - Block of 4s is moved slightly right and downwards.
   - Again, blocks are moved towards the bottom of the grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - Output shifts:
     - Block of 7s is moved downwards.
     - Block of 9s is moved to the right and downwards.
   - The movement is consistent with blocks being shifted towards the bottom right.

**General Transformation Rule:**
- The input grid contains blocks of colored numbers, which are moved closer to the bottom of the grid in the output.
- The blocks are shifted downwards and sometimes to the right. This movement maintains the integrity of the block (meaning the block shape is preserved).

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Apply the rule of shifting these blocks down and to the bottom right while maintaining their shape.

Let's implement this transformation for the given test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples to understand the transformation rule. 

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a shape of 1s and a shape of 6s.
   - **Output:** Both shapes are moved to the bottom of the grid, with 6s on the left and 1s shifted right and down.
   - **Observation:** The shapes are shifted downwards and to the left as much as possible without altering their relative horizontal position.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains a shape of 3s and a shape of 4s.
   - **Output:** Both shapes are shifted downward. 
   - **Observation:** The 3s are moved to the bottom-left, and 4s are moved downward while maintaining their relative horizontal position.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** 8s and 4s are moved downward, maintaining relative horizontal order.
   - **Observation:** The 8s are shifted down to the bottom-left and 4s are shifted downward, maintaining their relative horizontal position.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains shapes of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** 7s and 9s are moved downward, with 7s on the bottom-left.
   - **Observation:** The 7s are shifted down to the bottom-left and 9s are shifted downward, maintaining their relative horizontal position.

The transformation rule appears to involve:
- Identifying distinct shapes of numbers in the grid (ignoring isolated single lines or blocks).
- Shifting these shapes downwards and to the left as much as possible, maintaining their relative horizontal position and shape integrity.

The errors in the previous responses are due to incorrect shifting or not maintaining the correct relative position of shapes.

**Corrected Transformation Rule:**
- Identify non-black number shapes in the grid.
- Shift these shapes downward to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their relative horizontal position as much as possible.

Now, let's apply this rule to the additional test input.

**Test Input:**
- Contains shapes of 2s and 3s.
- We need to shift these shapes down to the bottom, maintaining their relative horizontal position and shape.

Implementation Steps:
1. Identify the shapes of 2s and 3s.
2. Shift them downward to the bottom, maintaining their relative horizontal position and shape integrity.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples again, focusing on identifying consistent patterns in the transformation process.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains clusters of 1s and 6s.
   - Output: Clusters of 1s and 6s are shifted down and slightly to the right, maintaining their shape.
   - Observation: Clusters are moved towards the bottom of the grid, preserving their horizontal and vertical relationships.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains clusters of 3s and 4s.
   - Output: Clusters of 3s and 4s are shifted downward, with the 4s slightly to the right.
   - Observation: The clusters are moved closer to the bottom of the grid, while maintaining the relative position of 4s to the right of 3s.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains clusters of 8s and 4s.
   - Output: The cluster of 8s is shifted downward and slightly to the left, while the cluster of 4s is also moved downward.
   - Observation: The clusters are shifted downward, maintaining their relative shapes.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains clusters of 7s and 9s.
   - Output: Clusters of 7s and 9s are moved downward, with 9s slightly to the right.
   - Observation: The clusters are shifted down, maintaining their relative structures.

**General Transformation Rule:**
- The main operation is shifting clusters of numbers downward and slightly to the right, while preserving their relative shapes and horizontal relationships.
- The primary movement is downward towards the bottom of the grid.

**Application to the Test Input:**
- The test input contains clusters of 2s and 3s.
- Apply the rule by moving these clusters downward, maintaining their relative positions and shapes.

Let's determine the correct output for the given test input by applying this clarified transformation rule.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's analyze the examples again to identify the correct transformation rule.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains a block of 1s in the upper-left and a block of 6s in the lower-left.
   - Output: Block of 1s is shifted rightwards and downwards. Block of 6s is shifted downwards.
   - Observation: Blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining their shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - Output: Block of 3s is shifted downwards and slightly right. Block of 4s is shifted downwards.
   - Observation: Blocks are shifted downwards and sometimes right, tending towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - Output: Block of 8s is shifted downwards. Block of 4s is shifted downwards and slightly right.
   - Observation: Blocks are moved towards the bottom-right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - Output: Block of 7s is shifted downwards. Block of 9s is shifted downwards and slightly right.
   - Observation: Again, blocks are moved towards the bottom-right.

**Correct Transformation Rule:**
- Each colored block in the input grid is moved towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The movement is primarily downwards, with a secondary component of moving right if space allows.
- The block's shape is preserved during the shift.
- Each block is shifted as far as possible towards the bottom-right without overlapping other blocks or exiting the grid boundaries.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- We need to apply the rule by shifting these blocks down and to the right while maintaining their shape.
- The 2s block should be shifted down and right as far as possible, then the 3s block should follow the same rule.

Now, let's implement the correct transformation for the given test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, we need to carefully analyze the given examples. Let's break them down to identify a consistent pattern or operation that transforms the input to the output.

**Example 1:**
- **Input**: Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
- **Output**: 
  - The block of 1s (a cross shape) is now shifted downwards to the bottom row, and leftwards to the left-most column.
  - The block of 6s (a T shape) is also shifted downwards and leftwards.
- **Observation**: The non-zero blocks are moved to the bottom and left of the grid.

**Example 2:**
- **Input**: Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
- **Output**: 
  - The block of 3s is shifted to the bottom-left corner.
  - The block of 4s is also shifted downwards and leftwards.
- **Observation**: Non-zero blocks are shifted towards the bottom-left.

**Example 3:**
- **Input**: Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
- **Output**: 
  - The block of 8s is shifted to the bottom-left.
  - The block of 4s is shifted towards the bottom-left.
- **Observation**: Non-zero blocks are moved towards the bottom-left.

**Example 4:**
- **Input**: Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
- **Output**: 
  - The block of 7s is moved to the bottom-left.
  - The block of 9s is shifted towards the bottom-left.
- **Observation**: Non-zero blocks are moved to the bottom-left.

**General Transformation Rule:**
- For each connected non-zero block in the input, shift the block to the bottom-left corner of the grid in the output. The left-most part of the block should align with the left column, and the bottom-most part of the block should align with the bottom row.
- This involves moving blocks as far down as possible, and as far left as possible, while maintaining their shape.

**Application to Test Input:**
The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s. According to the rule:
- The block of 2s should be shifted to the bottom-left.
- The block of 3s should be shifted to the bottom-left.

Let's implement this transformation for the given test input.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the provided examples to determine the correct transformation rule:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of blue (1s) and pink (6s).
   - The output grid shows that the pink blocks are moved downwards, and the blue blocks are also moved downwards.
   - The blocks are placed in a way that maintains their shape but shifts them towards the bottom of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of green (3s) and yellow (4s).
   - The output grid shows the green blocks moved downwards and slightly right, and the yellow blocks also moved downwards.
   - Again, the blocks are moved towards the bottom but maintain their structure.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of purple (8s) and yellow (4s).
   - The output grid shows the purple blocks moved downwards, while the yellow blocks are also moved downwards.
   - The blocks are rearranged towards the bottom of the grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of orange (7s) and brown (9s).
   - The output grid shows the orange blocks moved downwards and brown blocks moved downwards.
   - The blocks are shifted towards the bottom of the grid.

**Common Observations:**
- In each example, the colored blocks are shifted towards the bottom of the grid while maintaining their original block shape.
- The blocks are moved down as far as possible without overlapping each other.
- The order of blocks from top to bottom in the input is preserved in the output.

**Transformation Rule:**
- The main transformation is to shift each group of connected colored blocks downwards as far as possible.
- Ensure no overlapping between different colored blocks and maintain their original structure.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of red (2s) and green (3s).
- We should shift the block of red (2s) downwards as far as possible, keeping their structure.
- Similarly, shift the block of green (3s) downwards while maintaining the structure and ensuring no overlap with the red block.

Let's apply this transformation to the given test input.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's analyze the examples again to identify the correct transformation rule.

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains a block of 1s in the upper-left and a block of 6s in the lower-left.
   - Output: Block of 1s is shifted rightwards and downwards. Block of 6s is shifted downwards.
   - Observation: Blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining their shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - Output: Block of 3s is shifted downwards and slightly right. Block of 4s is shifted downwards.
   - Observation: Blocks are shifted downwards and sometimes right, tending towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - Output: Block of 8s is shifted downwards. Block of 4s is shifted downwards and slightly right.
   - Observation: Blocks are moved towards the bottom-right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - Output: Block of 7s is shifted downwards. Block of 9s is shifted downwards and slightly right.
   - Observation: Again, blocks are moved towards the bottom-right.

**Correct Transformation Rule:**
- Each colored block in the input grid is moved towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The movement is primarily downwards, with a secondary component of moving right if space allows.
- The block's shape is preserved during the shift.
- Each block is shifted as far as possible towards the bottom-right without overlapping other blocks or exiting the grid boundaries.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- We need to apply the rule by shifting these blocks down and to the right while maintaining their shape.
- The 2s block should be shifted down and right as far as possible, then the 3s block should follow the same rule.

Now, let's implement the correct transformation for the given test input.

Response 2

<reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the provided examples to determine the correct transformation rule:

1. **Example 1:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of blue (1s) and pink (6s).
   - The output grid shows that the pink blocks are moved downwards, and the blue blocks are also moved downwards.
   - The blocks are placed in a way that maintains their shape but shifts them towards the bottom of the grid.

2. **Example 2:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of green (3s) and yellow (4s).
   - The output grid shows the green blocks moved downwards and slightly right, and the yellow blocks also moved downwards.
   - Again, the blocks are moved towards the bottom but maintain their structure.

3. **Example 3:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of purple (8s) and yellow (4s).
   - The output grid shows the purple blocks moved downwards, while the yellow blocks are also moved downwards.
   - The blocks are rearranged towards the bottom of the grid.

4. **Example 4:**
   - The input grid contains blocks of orange (7s) and brown (9s).
   - The output grid shows the orange blocks moved downwards and brown blocks moved downwards.
   - The blocks are shifted towards the bottom of the grid.

**Common Observations:**
- In each example, the colored blocks are shifted towards the bottom of the grid while maintaining their original block shape.
- The blocks are moved down as far as possible without overlapping each other.
- The order of blocks from top to bottom in the input is preserved in the output.

**Transformation Rule:**
- The main transformation is to shift each group of connected colored blocks downwards as far as possible.
- Ensure no overlapping between different colored blocks and maintain their original structure.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of red (2s) and green (3s).
- We should shift the block of red (2s) downwards as far as possible, keeping their structure.
- Similarly, shift the block of green (3s) downwards while maintaining the structure and ensuring no overlap with the red block.

Let's apply this transformation to the given test input.

</output>


Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples to fully understand the transformation rule and identify any mistakes in the previous responses.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** Contains two distinct blocks: one of 1s (blue) and another of 6s (pink).
- **Output:** The blocks are shifted downwards, with pink moving more prominently down and blue slightly right.
- The pink block moves down by 4 rows, while the blue block shifts by 1 position right and 3 positions down.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** Has two distinct blocks: one of 3s (green) and another of 4s (yellow).
- **Output:** The green block shifts downwards by 3 rows and slightly right, while the yellow block shifts downwards by 3 rows and slightly right.
- The green block moves down by 3 rows and right by 1 column, while the yellow block moves down 2 rows and right 2 columns.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s (purple) and 4s (yellow).
- **Output:** The purple block shifts downwards, and the yellow block shifts down and slightly right.
- The purple block moves down by 3 rows, while the yellow block shifts down by 1 row and right by 2 columns.

**Example 4:**
- **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s (orange) and 9s (brown).
- **Output:** The orange block shifts downwards, while the brown block shifts downwards and slightly right.
- The orange block moves down by 3 rows, and the brown block moves down by 2 rows and right by 3 columns.

**Common Observations:**
- Blocks are generally shifted downwards, with some also shifting to the right.
- The blocks maintain their shape during the shift.
- The shift appears to be determined by available space in the grid, with blocks moving as far as possible towards the bottom-right without overlapping or exiting the grid boundaries.

**Transformation Rule:**
- Each block of connected cells of the same color is moved as far down as possible without overlap, while maintaining its shape.
- If space allows, a block may also shift slightly to the right, but the primary direction is downward.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s (red) and 3s (green).
- The red block (2s) should be moved downwards by 4 rows and slightly right if space permits.
- The green block (3s) should be moved downwards by 3 rows and slightly right if space permits.
- Both blocks should maintain their shape and not overlap.

Now, let's implement this transformation for the given test input.

   - **Output:** The 3s are shifted downwards and right. The 4s are shifted rightwards and then down.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted down and sometimes right, moving towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 8s are shifted downwards, and the 4s are shifted rightwards and then down.
   - **Observation:** Similar movement towards the bottom-right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The 7s are moved downwards, and the 9s are shifted rightwards and down.
   - **Observation:** Again, blocks are repositioned towards the bottom-right.

### Common Observations:
- Each block in the examples is moved downwards as far as possible, and then if possible, shifted to the right.
- The transformation rule involves moving the blocks to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The shape of the block is preserved during the shift.
- The order of blocks from the top of the grid in the input is preserved in the output.

### Transformation Rule:
- For each block of connected colored cells, shift them downwards to the bottom-most position possible.
- If space allows, shift them right towards the bottom-right corner.
- Maintain the block's original shape during the shift.
- Blocks should not overlap each other, and each block's relative position (order from top to bottom in the input) should be preserved in the output.

### Application to Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Shift the 2s downwards as far as possible, then shift them right if space allows, maintaining their shape.
- Do the same for the 3s, ensuring they don't overlap with the 2s and keeping the order.

Now let's apply this rule to the given test input.

Test Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
- The block of 2s should be moved to the bottom-most position, then shifted right.
- The block of 3s should be moved similarly, ensuring no overlap with the block of 2s.

Now let's generate the output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To correctly determine the transformation rule, we need to carefully analyze the patterns across all provided examples.

**Observations from Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input has blocks of blue (1s) and pink (6s).
   - In the output, pink blocks have been moved downwards and leftwards, and blue blocks have been moved downwards and rightwards.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has blocks of green (3s) and yellow (4s).
   - In the output, green blocks are moved downwards and rightwards, and yellow blocks are moved downwards and leftwards.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input has blocks of purple (8s) and yellow (4s).
   - In the output, purple blocks are moved downwards and rightwards, yellow blocks are moved downwards and leftwards.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has blocks of orange (7s) and brown (9s).
   - In the output, orange blocks are moved downwards and rightwards, brown blocks are moved downwards and leftwards.

**Common Patterns:**
- Each colored block is moved downwards as far as possible.
- Blocks of one color are moved leftwards, while blocks of another color are moved rightwards.
- The blocks maintain their original shape and do not overlap.

**Correct Transformation Rule:**
- Identify the blocks of connected colors.
- Move each block downwards as far as possible.
- For two distinct color blocks, one block moves leftwards while the other moves rightwards, as far as possible without overlapping or going out of bounds.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of red (2s) and green (3s).
- We should move the block of red (2s) downwards and rightwards as far as possible.
- Move the block of green (3s) downwards and leftwards as far as possible.

By following this corrected rule, let's construct the output for the test input.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the examples again and understand the pattern:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: Contains a block of 1s (blue) and a block of 6s (pink).
   - Output: The block of 1s is moved downwards and slightly right, while the block of 6s is moved downwards.
   - Key observation: The blocks are shifted downwards, and the block of 1s slightly right.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 3s (green) and 4s (yellow).
   - Output: The block of 3s is moved downwards and slightly right, while the block of 4s is moved downwards.
   - Key observation: Blocks are shifted downwards.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 8s (purple) and 4s (yellow).
   - Output: The block of 8s is moved downwards, and the block of 4s is slightly moved right.
   - Key observation: Blocks are rearranged towards the bottom and slightly right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: Contains blocks of 7s (orange) and 9s (brown).
   - Output: The block of 7s is moved downwards, and the block of 9s is slightly moved right.
   - Key observation: Blocks are shifted towards the bottom and slightly right.

**Common Observations:**
- Each group of connected colored blocks is shifted downwards and slightly towards the right if space allows.
- The movement is such that the blocks maintain their shape and do not overlap.
- The order of blocks from top to bottom is preserved, but they are shifted downwards as far as possible.

**Transformation Rule:**
- The main transformation is to shift each group of connected colored blocks downward and slightly to the right, maintaining their original shape.
- Blocks are moved as far as possible towards the bottom and to the right without overlapping.

**Application to Test Input:**
- Test input contains blocks of 2s (red) and 3s (green).
- Apply the rule by shifting these blocks down and slightly right, ensuring no overlap.

Let's correctly apply this transformation to the test input.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples more closely:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input contains two distinct blocks: one of 1s and another of 6s.
   - In the output, the block of 1s is shifted right and down, while the block of 6s is shifted down.
   - The new position of the blocks in the output suggests that the blocks are being moved towards the bottom-right.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - In the output, the block of 3s is shifted down and slightly right, and the block of 4s is shifted down.
   - Again, the blocks appear to be moved towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - In the output, both blocks are shifted downwards, with some rightward movement for the block of 4s.
   - The blocks are moved as far down and right as possible without overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - In the output, both blocks are shifted downwards, with the block of 9s also moving slightly right.
   - Consistently, the blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right while preserving their shape.

**Common Observations:**
- Each distinct block of numbers is moved as far down and right as possible.
- The blocks maintain their shape and do not overlap with each other.
- The movement is constrained by other blocks and the grid boundaries.

**Correct Transformation Rule:**
- Each connected block of the same number is shifted towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The blocks are moved as far as possible without overlapping or going beyond the grid boundaries.
- Each block maintains its original shape during the shift.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Following the transformation rule, shift each block towards the bottom-right corner.
- Ensure that the blocks do not overlap and maintain their shape.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the given test input.

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's analyze the examples again to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Analyzing the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a block of 1s and a block of 6s.
   - **Output:** The 6s are moved downwards to the bottom-most available space. The 1s are also shifted downwards and right.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted downwards and to the right, maintaining their shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 3s are shifted downwards and right. The 4s are shifted rightwards and then down.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted down and sometimes right, moving towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 8s are shifted downwards, and the 4s are shifted rightwards and then down.
   - **Observation:** Similar movement towards the bottom-right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The 7s are moved downwards, and the 9s are shifted rightwards and down.
   - **Observation:** Again, blocks are repositioned towards the bottom-right.

### Common Observations:
- Each block in the examples is moved downwards as far as possible, and then if possible, shifted to the right.
- The transformation rule involves moving the blocks to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The shape of the block is preserved during the shift.
- The order of blocks from the top of the grid in the input is preserved in the output.

### Transformation Rule:
- For each block of connected colored cells, shift them downwards to the bottom-most position possible.
- If space allows, shift them right towards the bottom-right corner.
- Maintain the block's original shape during the shift.
- Blocks should not overlap each other, and each block's relative position (order from top to bottom in the input) should be preserved in the output.

### Application to Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Shift the 2s downwards as far as possible, then shift them right if space allows, maintaining their shape.
- Do the same for the 3s, ensuring they don't overlap with the 2s and keeping the order.

Now let's apply this rule to the given test input.

Test Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```
- The block of 2s should be moved to the bottom-most position, then shifted right.
- The block of 3s should be moved similarly, ensuring no overlap with the block of 2s.

Now let's generate the output grid.

Response 2

<reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples more closely:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input contains two distinct blocks: one of 1s and another of 6s.
   - In the output, the block of 1s is shifted right and down, while the block of 6s is shifted down.
   - The new position of the blocks in the output suggests that the blocks are being moved towards the bottom-right.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input has blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - In the output, the block of 3s is shifted down and slightly right, and the block of 4s is shifted down.
   - Again, the blocks appear to be moved towards the bottom-right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - In the output, both blocks are shifted downwards, with some rightward movement for the block of 4s.
   - The blocks are moved as far down and right as possible without overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input has blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - In the output, both blocks are shifted downwards, with the block of 9s also moving slightly right.
   - Consistently, the blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right while preserving their shape.

**Common Observations:**
- Each distinct block of numbers is moved as far down and right as possible.
- The blocks maintain their shape and do not overlap with each other.
- The movement is constrained by other blocks and the grid boundaries.

**Correct Transformation Rule:**
- Each connected block of the same number is shifted towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The blocks are moved as far as possible without overlapping or going beyond the grid boundaries.
- Each block maintains its original shape during the shift.

**Application to Test Input:**
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Following the transformation rule, shift each block towards the bottom-right corner.
- Ensure that the blocks do not overlap and maintain their shape.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the given test input.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the examples again and identify the consistent pattern. 

### Detailed Analysis of Each Example:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a block of 1s and a block of 6s.
   - **Output:** The block of 1s is moved downwards and rightwards. The block of 6s is moved downwards.
   - **Observation:** Blocks of numbers are moved to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their shape. The relative order (6s above 1s) in the input is preserved in the output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 3s are moved downwards and shifted to the right. The 4s are moved rightwards and then downwards.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted towards the bottom and right of the grid. The relative vertical order (3s above 4s) is maintained.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 8s are moved downwards, while the 4s are moved rightwards and then down.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining the original order of blocks.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** Both blocks are moved downwards and rightwards. The block of 9s is shifted more towards the right.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are consistently moved towards the bottom-right, preserving relative positions.

### Common Observations:
- Each distinct block of numbers is moved downward as far as possible and then rightwards.
- The shape of each block is preserved during movement.
- The relative vertical order of blocks is maintained in the output.

### Conclusion:
The transformation rule involves shifting each connected block of numbers downwards and rightwards towards the bottom-right corner of the grid. The blocks should not overlap and should maintain their original shapes. The relative order (bottom before top) is preserved.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Shift the block of 2s downward and rightward, maintaining its structure.
- Similarly, shift the block of 3s downward and rightward, ensuring no overlap with the block of 2s.
- Maintain the blocks in their original order (2s above 3s).

Now, let's apply this rule to the given test input to generate the correct output.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
Let's carefully analyze the examples again to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The block of 1s is moved to the bottom-right corner, and the block of 6s is also moved downwards.
   - **Observation:** The blocks are shifted downward and to the right, filling available space in the grid from bottom-right upwards.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The block of 3s is moved downward and slightly right, while the block of 4s is moved downward and right.
   - **Observation:** Blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining their shape and order.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The block of 8s is shifted downward, as is the block of 4s.
   - **Observation:** The blocks are moved as far down and right as possible without overlapping, filling the grid from bottom-right upwards.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The block of 7s and the block of 9s are moved downwards and right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape.

### Common Observations:
- Each block of numbers is shifted downward and right as much as possible.
- Blocks must maintain their original shape and do not overlap.
- The order of blocks (from top to bottom in the input) is preserved in the output grid.

### Transformation Rule:
- For each distinct block of connected numbers, shift them as far down and to the right as possible.
- Maintain the block's original shape during the shift.
- Blocks should not overlap each other, and their order from the top of the grid in the input should be preserved in the output.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- The block of 2s should be moved downwards and then to the right, if possible.
- The block of 3s should also be moved similarly, ensuring no overlap with the 2s and preserving the order.

Now let's apply this rule to the given test input.

Test Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- The block of 2s will be shifted to the bottom-right corner.
- The block of 3s will also be moved down and right, ensuring that it doesn't overlap with the 2s.

Considering the pattern in the examples, let's generate the corrected output grid.

Response: <reasoning>
Let's closely analyze the examples to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a block of 1s and a block of 6s.
   - **Output:** The 1s are shifted down and slightly to the right; the 6s are shifted down and right.
   - **Pattern:** Both blocks move toward the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 3s and 4s are shifted downwards and to the right.
   - **Pattern:** Again, blocks move toward the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 8s and 4s are shifted downwards and slightly to the right.
   - **Pattern:** Consistent movement towards the bottom-right, maintaining shape and avoiding overlap.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The 7s and 9s are shifted towards the bottom-right.
   - **Pattern:** Movement towards bottom-right while maintaining shape and avoiding overlap.

### Common Observations
- Each block of connected cells is moved as far down and to the right as possible without overlapping other blocks or exiting the grid.
- The shape of each block is maintained during this transformation.
- The order in which blocks appear from top to bottom in the input seems to be preserved in the output.

### Transformation Rule
- Identify each connected block of numbers in the input grid.
- Move each block downwards as far as possible within the grid without overlap.
- Also shift each block to the right as far as possible, still without overlap.
- Maintain the original shape of each block and ensure they do not exit the grid boundaries or overlap with other blocks.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input
Given the test input, we need to apply the rule by:
- Identifying the blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Moving the block of 2s as far down and to the right as possible.
- Then moving the block of 3s as far down and to the right as possible, ensuring no overlap with the 2s.

Let's apply the rule correctly to the test input grid.

Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the provided examples to determine what transformation is being applied:

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The blocks of 1s and 6s are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** Each block is moved independently towards the bottom-right corner of the grid while maintaining its shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** The shape of each block is preserved, and they move as far down and right as possible without overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks move towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** Movement is to the bottom-right, with blocks maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

### Common Transformation Rule:
- For each block of connected cells of the same color:
  - Move the block as far down and to the right as possible.
  - Maintain the shape of each block.
  - Ensure blocks do not overlap.
  - Blocks are moved to the bottom-right corner without changing their relative order from the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Each block should be shifted towards the bottom-right corner.
- The block of 2s and the block of 3s should not overlap, and each should maintain its original shape.
- We need to ensure that the 2s and 3s are moved as far as possible without overlapping.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the given test input.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples more closely and systematically:

### Observations from the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The block of 6s is moved to the bottom left corner. The block of 1s is moved downwards and slightly to the right, maintaining the shape.
   - **Inference:** Blocks are shifted downwards and possibly rightwards as far as possible.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The block of 3s is moved downwards and slightly to the right. The block of 4s is moved downwards, maintaining the shape.
   - **Inference:** Similar shifting downwards and rightwards.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The block of 8s is moved downwards. The block of 4s is moved downwards and slightly to the right.
   - **Inference:** Shifting downwards and sometimes rightwards, maintaining non-overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** Both blocks are moved downwards, with 9s also moving right.
   - **Inference:** Blocks are moved towards the bottom-right corner.

### Common Observations:
- Each connected block of numbers is shifted as far down and right as possible.
- Blocks maintain their original shape and do not overlap.
- The output for each block does not exceed the grid boundaries.

### Transformation Rule:
- Identify each connected component (block) of the same number in the input grid.
- Shift each block downwards and rightwards towards the bottom-right corner while retaining the shape.
- Ensure no overlap between different blocks and no exceeding the grid boundary.

### Application to Test Input:
- **Test Input:** Contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- **Approach:** Follow the same transformation rule:
  - Shift the block of 2s downwards and rightwards to the bottom-right corner.
  - Shift the block of 3s similarly, ensuring no overlap with the block of 2s.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the given test input.

Test Input:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

- The block of 2s should be shifted to the bottom-right.
- The block of 3s should be shifted similarly, without overlapping the 2s.

Applying this transformation, the output grid will be:

Here are two responses that you've previously returned. Both of them were incorrect.

Closely examine both the reasoning (enclosed in <reasoning> tags) and the output grid in both responses to determine what the issue is. Then, based on your previous responses, return a corrected output grid along with your reasoning.

You will need to carefully reason to determine the issue in both responses. Start your response by doing this reasoning in <reasoning> tags. Then, return the corrected output grid enclosed in <output> tags. The output grid should follow the format of list[list[int]] in Python. 

Make sure to include ONLY the output grid in list[list[int]] format without any other text or code within the <output> tags.


Response 1

<reasoning>
Let's closely analyze the examples to determine the correct transformation rule.

### Observations from Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a block of 1s and a block of 6s.
   - **Output:** The 1s are shifted down and slightly to the right; the 6s are shifted down and right.
   - **Pattern:** Both blocks move toward the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 3s and 4s are shifted downwards and to the right.
   - **Pattern:** Again, blocks move toward the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The 8s and 4s are shifted downwards and slightly to the right.
   - **Pattern:** Consistent movement towards the bottom-right, maintaining shape and avoiding overlap.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The 7s and 9s are shifted towards the bottom-right.
   - **Pattern:** Movement towards bottom-right while maintaining shape and avoiding overlap.

### Common Observations
- Each block of connected cells is moved as far down and to the right as possible without overlapping other blocks or exiting the grid.
- The shape of each block is maintained during this transformation.
- The order in which blocks appear from top to bottom in the input seems to be preserved in the output.

### Transformation Rule
- Identify each connected block of numbers in the input grid.
- Move each block downwards as far as possible within the grid without overlap.
- Also shift each block to the right as far as possible, still without overlap.
- Maintain the original shape of each block and ensure they do not exit the grid boundaries or overlap with other blocks.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input
Given the test input, we need to apply the rule by:
- Identifying the blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Moving the block of 2s as far down and to the right as possible.
- Then moving the block of 3s as far down and to the right as possible, ensuring no overlap with the 2s.

Let's apply the rule correctly to the test input grid.

 [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]]
</output>

Response 2

<reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the provided examples to determine what transformation is being applied:

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The blocks of 1s and 6s are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** Each block is moved independently towards the bottom-right corner of the grid while maintaining its shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** The shape of each block is preserved, and they move as far down and right as possible without overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks move towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** Movement is to the bottom-right, with blocks maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

### Common Transformation Rule:
- For each block of connected cells of the same color:
  - Move the block as far down and to the right as possible.
  - Maintain the shape of each block.
  - Ensure blocks do not overlap.
  - Blocks are moved to the bottom-right corner without changing their relative order from the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
- The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s.
- Each block should be shifted towards the bottom-right corner.
- The block of 2s and the block of 3s should not overlap, and each should maintain its original shape.
- We need to ensure that the 2s and 3s are moved as far as possible without overlapping.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the given test input.

 [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]]
</output>


Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the examples more thoroughly, especially considering the mistakes in previous responses.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The block of 1s is shifted down and slightly right; the block of 6s is also shifted down and right.
   - **Observation:** Each block is moved independently towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining its shape and not overlapping with others or the grid boundary.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks of 3s and 4s are shifted towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** Blocks maintain their shape and avoid overlap, moving down and right.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted downwards and towards the bottom-right.
   - **Observation:** Movement towards the bottom-right while maintaining shape and non-overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved towards the bottom-right.
   - **Observation:** Similar movement is observed, ensuring no overlap and maintaining their shape.

### Rule Extraction:
- The primary transformation rule involves moving each block of connected cells (of the same color) as far down and to the right as possible.
- The blocks must maintain their shape and avoid overlapping with other blocks or going out of the grid bounds.
- Blocks are moved independently of each other and are not allowed to overlap.

### Correct Application to the Test Input:
- Identify the blocks of 2s and 3s in the input.
- Move each block down and to the right as far as possible without overlap, maintaining their original shape.
- The order in which blocks are moved can affect the final placement. The order should be such that the final placement matches the pattern observed in outputs.

Let's apply this rule to the test input:
- First, move the block of 2s as it appears higher in the grid.
- Then, shift the block of 3s, ensuring no overlap occurs.

Upon reviewing previous mistakes, it seems the correct configuration was not achieved due to incorrect block placement order or overlap. Let's ensure blocks are moved correctly in the order observed in outputs.

Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule, let's analyze the provided examples more thoroughly.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The 1s and 6s are shifted downwards and to the right.
   - **Observation:** Each block is moved independently without overlapping, and their shapes are preserved. The blocks are moved to the farthest possible position towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining their original order from top to bottom.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape.
   - **Observation:** Again, blocks are moved as far as possible towards the bottom-right without overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted downwards and to the right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks move towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** Movement is to the bottom-right, but blocks maintain their shape and do not overlap.

### Common Transformation Rule:
- Identify each connected block of numbers (same color).
- Move each block as far down and to the right as possible without overlapping other blocks.
- Maintain the original shape of each block.
- Keep the blocks within the grid boundaries.
- The relative vertical order of the blocks from the input is preserved in the output.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:

For the test input:
- **Block of 2s:** The block should be moved as far down and to the right as possible, following the rule of preserving the order and avoiding overlap.
- **Block of 3s:** This block should also be moved similarly, while ensuring it does not overlap with the block of 2s.

Given this understanding, let's apply the transformation to the test input grid.

1. **Identifying Blocks:**
   - Block of 2s: [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)]
   - Block of 3s: [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)]

2. **Moving Blocks:**
   - Block of 2s can be moved to start at (5,0).
   - Block of 3s can be moved to start at (8,3).

Following these transformations, the output grid will be as follows:

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To identify the correct transformation rule, let's carefully analyze the provided examples.

### Observations from Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** The blocks of 1s and 6s are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** Each block is moved independently towards the bottom-right corner of the grid while maintaining its shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** The shape of each block is preserved, and they move as far down and right as possible without overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks move towards the bottom-right corner, maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** Movement is to the bottom-right, with blocks maintaining their shape and not overlapping.

### Common Transformation Rule:
- For each block of connected cells of the same color:
  - Move the block as far down and to the right as possible.
  - Maintain the shape of each block.
  - Ensure blocks do not overlap.
  - Blocks are moved to the bottom-right corner without changing their relative order from the input grid.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
The test input contains blocks of 2s and 3s. Each block should be shifted towards the bottom-right corner. The block of 2s and the block of 3s should not overlap, and each should maintain its original shape. We need to ensure that the 2s and 3s are moved as far as possible without overlapping.

Upon reviewing the previous responses, the mistakes in the outputs seem to involve not correctly applying the rule to ensure non-overlapping movement to the bottom-right based on the pattern observed in example outputs.

Let's apply this transformation rule correctly to the given test input.

1. **Block of 2s:**
   - Identify the positions of all connected 2s.
   - Move them as far down and right as possible without overlapping other blocks.

2. **Block of 3s:**
   - Identify the positions of all connected 3s.
   - Move them as far down and right as possible without overlapping the block of 2s.

By correctly following this transformation rule, the 2s should be placed first, followed by the 3s, ensuring no overlap occurs and maintaining the original shape of each block.

Now, let's generate the correct output based on this understanding.

</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the correct transformation rule for the given test input, let's analyze the provided examples and the previous incorrect responses.

### Observations from Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Blocks of 1s and 6s.
   - **Output:** These blocks are moved downwards and to the right without overlapping and maintaining their shape.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved downwards and to the right, maintaining their shape and without overlapping.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks move downwards and to the right, maintaining their shape and without overlap.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are moved downwards and to the right, maintaining their shape and without overlapping.

### Common Transformation Rule:
- Each block of connected cells of the same color is moved towards the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- The shape of each block is maintained.
- Blocks should not overlap.
- The relative order of blocks (in terms of their vertical position) is preserved.

### Mistakes in Previous Responses:
- The blocks were not moved as far as they could be towards the bottom-right corner.
- In both previous attempts, the final positions of blocks were incorrect because they did not consistently apply the rule of maximizing the move towards the bottom-right without overlap.

### Correct Transformation Application:
- Identify each connected block of colors in the provided test input.
- Move each block as far down and to the right as possible without overlapping with other blocks and maintaining the original shape.

Applying this logic to the test input:

- Move the block of 2s down and right as far as possible.
- Move the block of 3s similarly as far down and right as possible without overlapping with the 2s.

Let's apply this transformation:

1. The block of 2s, starting from its earliest position at (1,0), can be shifted down to start at (7,1).
2. The block of 3s can be shifted to start at (8,5).

Let's construct the output grid based on these movements.

 [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]]
</output>
Response: <reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's carefully examine the given examples and the responses.

### Analyzing the Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** Contains a block of 1s and a block of 6s.
   - **Output:** Blocks appear shifted downwards and to the right, with the 6s moved further down compared to the 1s.
   - **Observation:** The two blocks maintain their shape and are moved independently, ending up in the bottom two rows.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 3s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted down and to the right.
   - **Observation:** Again, each block moves towards the bottom-right corner. The 3s and 4s do not overlap and maintain their shape.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 8s and 4s.
   - **Output:** The blocks are shifted downwards and to the right.
   - **Observation:** The blocks maintain shape and do not overlap. They are moved towards the bottom-right.

4. **Example 4:**
   - **Input:** Contains blocks of 7s and 9s.
   - **Output:** The blocks move towards the bottom-right corner.
   - **Observation:** The blocks maintain their shape and do not overlap.

### Common Observations:
- Each connected block of numbers is moved as far down and to the right as possible without overlapping other blocks or leaving the grid.
- Blocks maintain their original shape.
- The relative order by which blocks are processed seems to influence the final position, with blocks further down being able to move more freely.

### Identifying the Issue:
Both previous responses attempted to move blocks directly toward the bottom-right without considering the relative order and final resting positions of blocks.

### Correct Transformation Rule:
- Identify each block of connected numbers in the input grid.
- Move each block independently as far down and to the right as possible, filling from the bottom-right upwards.
- Ensure that no blocks overlap and that the grid boundaries are respected.

### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:
1. **Block of 2s**: 
   - Initially located at the top-left part of the grid.
   - Should be moved down to the bottom-most row and shifted right.
   
2. **Block of 3s**:
   - Initially located to the right of the 2s.
   - Should be moved as far down and to the right as possible, ensuring no overlap with the 2s.

Based on this rule, the 2s should occupy the bottom-left corner, and the 3s can be positioned directly adjacent to them, ensuring no overlap.

Let's apply this reasoning to generate the correct output for the given test input.

========== SYSTEM PROMPT ==========

You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the inputs. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also an additional test input without a known output (or possibly multiple additional inputs).

Your task is to either determine the transformation rule and implement it in code, or directly predict what the output would be if the same transformation rule is applied to the provided test input. It is up to you which path to take.

The inputs and outputs are each "grids." A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). These grids will be shown to you as grids of numbers. Each number corresponds to a color in the image. The correspondence is as follows: black: 0, blue: 1, red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 4, grey: 5, pink: 6, orange: 7, purple: 8, brown: 9.

The transformation rule might have multiple components and might be fairly complex. It's also reasonably common that the transformation rule has one main rule (e.g., replace cells in XYZ pattern with color ABC), but has some sort of exception (e.g., don't replace cells if they have color DEF). So, you should be on the lookout for additional parts or exceptions that you might have missed so far. 
Consider explicitly asking yourself (in writing): "Are there any additional parts or exceptions to the transformation rule that I might have missed?" (Rules don't necessarily have multiple components or exceptions, but it's common enough that you should consider it.)

Here are some examples of transformation rules with multiple components or exceptions:

- There is a grey grid with black holes that have different shapes and the rule is to fill in these holes with colored cells. Further, the color to use for each hole depends on the size of the hole (in terms of the number of connected cells). 1-cell holes are filled with pink, 2-cell holes are filled with blue, and 3-cell holes are filled with red.
- The output is 3x3 while the input is 3x7. The output has red cells while the input has two "sub-grids" that are 3x3 and separated by a grey line in the middle. Each of the sub-grids has some colored cells (blue) and some black cells. The rule is to AND the two sub-grids together (i.e., take the intersection of where the two sub-grids are blue) and color the 3x3 cells in the output red if they are in the intersection and black otherwise.
- The grey rectangular outlines are filled with some color in the output. Pink, orange, and purple are used to fill in the voids in different cases. The color depends on the size of the black void inside the grey outline where it is pink if the void has 1 cell (1x1 void), orange if the gap has 4 cells, and purple if the gap was 9 cells. For each void, all of the filled-in colors are the same.
- The red shape in the input is moved. It is moved either horizontally or vertically. It is moved until moving it further would intersect with a purple shape. It is moved in the direction of the purple shape, that is, moved in whichever direction would involve it eventually intersecting with this purple shape.

These are just example rules; the actual transformation rule will be quite different. But, this should hopefully give you some sense of what transformation rules might look like.

You must make sure the transformation rule maps from each input to a single correct output. You need to resolve all potential uncertainties you might have about the transformation rule. For instance, if the examples always involve some particular color being changed to another color in the output, but which color it is changed to varies between different examples, then you need to figure out what determines the correct output color. 
Whenever there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in your current understanding of the transformation rule, you need to resolve them before implementing the transformation in code or returning the predicted output grid. You should resolve ambiguities and uncertainties by carefully analyzing the examples and using step-by-step reasoning.

Note that in each of these cases, you would need to find the rule by carefully examining the examples and using reasoning. You would then need to implement the transformation rule precisely, taking into account all possible cases and getting all of the details right (e.g., exactly where to place various things or exactly which color to use in each case). If the details aren't fully ironed out, you should do additional reasoning to do so before returning an answer.

You'll need to carefully reason in order to determine the transformation rule. Start your response by carefully reasoning in <reasoning></reasoning> tags.

You follow a particular reasoning style. You break down complex problems into smaller parts and reason through them step by step, arriving at sub-conclusions before stating an overall conclusion. This reduces the extent to which you need to do large leaps of reasoning.

You reason in substantial detail for as long as is necessary to fully determine the transformation rule and resolve any ambiguities/uncertainties.

After your reasoning, choose to either return the transformation rule implemented in code, or return the predicted output grid based on the test input. You must return your answer outside the <reasoning> tags.

If you choose to return the transformation rule implemented in code, write code in triple backticks (i.e. ```python (code) ```). You should write a function called transform which takes a single argument, the input grid as list[list[int]], and returns the transformed grid (also as list[list[int]]). Your Python code should not use libraries outside of the standard Python libraries besides numpy. You can create helper functions. You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation which works in general (for inputs which have the same properties as the example inputs and the additional input(s)). Don't write tests in your Python code, just output the transform function.

If you choose to directly predict the output grid that would result from applying the transformation rule to the given inputs. If you do this, return only the transformed grid along with your reasoning. MAKE SURE to enclose the transformed grid in <output></output> tags and that it follows the format of list[list[int]] in Python.

========== RESPONSE ==========

<reasoning>
To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

1. **Example 1 Analysis:**
   - Input Grid: 
     ```
     [[8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output Grid:
     ```
     [[8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],
      [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1],
      [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1]]
     ```
   - Observation: The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is extended to the right, repeating till the last zero is replaced by a number from the sequence. The same sequence is mirrored at the right end.

2. **Example 2 Analysis:**
   - Input Grid:
     ```
     [[3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output Grid:
     ```
     [[3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
      [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],
      [3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3],
      [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1]]
     ```
   - Observation: The same pattern is present. The non-zero numbers are extended to fill the row, and the sequence is mirrored at the end.

3. **Example 3 Analysis:**
   - Input Grid:
     ```
     [[2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 8, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```
   - Output Grid:
     ```
     [[2, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8, 2],
      [2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2],
      [2, 8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 3, 2]]
     ```
   - Observation: The rule is consistent with previous examples. The sequence of non-zero numbers is extended to fill the row, and the sequence is mirrored at the end.

**Hypothesized Transformation Rule:**
The transformation consists of two main steps:
   - Identify the non-zero sequence at the beginning of each row.
   - Extend this sequence to the right, filling all zeros, up to the point where the original sequence needs to be mirrored at the right end.

**Test Input Analysis:**
   - Input Grid:
     ```
     [[3, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
     ```

We will apply the same transformation rule here to predict the output.
- For each row, identify the initial sequence of non-zero numbers.
- Extend this sequence to the right until we reach the last zero.
- Mirror the sequence at the right end.

Let's apply this rule to the test input to generate the predicted output grid.
